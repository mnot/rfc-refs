     Bundle Protocol Version 7 Administrative Record Types Registry

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 9171 to clarify that Bundle Protocol
   Version 7 agents are expected to use the IANA "Bundle Administrative
   Record Types" registry to identify and document administrative record
   types.  This document also designates code points for Private and
   Experimental Use.

1.  Introduction

   An earlier specification [RFC7116] defined an IANA registry for
   administrative record type code points [IANA-BP] for use with the
   Bundle Protocol (BP) Version 6 (BPv6) [RFC5050].  When Bundle
   Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) was published in [RFC9171], it identified
   the IANA registry for administrative record types but did not update
   the table to be explicit about which entries applied to which Bundle
   Protocol version(s).  The BPv7 specification also did not
   discriminate between code point reservations and unassigned ranges
   for administrative record types.

   This document updates BPv7 to explicitly use the IANA "Bundle
   Administrative Record Types" registry as described in Section 2.
   This document makes a reservation of the zero value for consistency
   with BPv6.  This document also makes a reservation of high-valued
   code points for Private Use and Experimental Use in accordance with
   [RFC8126] to avoid collisions with assigned code points.

1.1.  Scope

   This document describes updates to the IANA "Bundle Administrative
   Record Types" registry and how a BPv7 agent is supposed to use that
   registry to identify administrative record types.

   This document does not specify how BPv6 and BPv7 can interoperate
   when both use the same code points or how a specific code point is to
   be interpreted either similarly or differently by Bundle Protocol
   versions.  The specification for each administrative record type is
   to define how the administrative record type relates to each BP
   version.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Administrative Record Types Registry

   This document updates the requirements in Section 6.1 of [RFC9171] to
   specify use of an existing IANA registry and updates that registry as
   described in Section 4.1.

   The code point allocated in Annex D of [CCSDS-BP] was never added to
   the IANA registry.  To avoid a collision, this document adds that
   allocation to the registry.

   Instead of using the list of types in Section 6.1 of [RFC9171], a
   BPv7 administrative element SHALL determine which administrative
   record type code values can be used by the "7" noted in the Bundle
   Protocol Version column of the IANA "Bundle Administrative Record
   Types" registry [IANA-BP].

   If an administrative element receives a not-well-formed application
   data unit (ADU) or an administrative record type code that is not
   able to be processed by the element, the record SHALL be ignored by
   the element.  The processing of a received administrative record ADU
   does not affect the fact that the bundle itself was delivered to the
   administrative element or any related bundle protocol agent
   processing of (e.g., status reports on) the enveloping bundle.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define any requirements or structures that
   introduce new security considerations.

   The existing security considerations of [RFC9171] still apply when
   using the IANA "Bundle Administrative Record Types" registry.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification modifies a BPv6 registry by extending it for BPv7.

4.1.  Bundle Administrative Record Types

   Within the "Bundle Protocol" registry group [IANA-BP], the "Bundle
   Administrative Record Types" registry has been updated to include a
   leftmost "Bundle Protocol Version" column.  New entries have been
   added and existing entries have been updated to include BP versions
   as in Table 1.  This document makes no changes to the registration
   procedures for this registry.
