      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Transport Services Architecture <xref target="RFC9621" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9621"/> defines a system that allows applications to flexibly use transport networking protocols. The API that such a system exposes to applications is defined as the Transport Services API <xref target="RFC9622" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9622"/>. This API is designed to be generic across multiple transport protocols and sets of protocol features.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">This document serves as a guide to implementing a system that provides a Transport Services API. This guide offers suggestions to developers, but it is not prescriptive: implementations are free to take any desired form as long as the API specification defined in <xref target="RFC9622" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9622"/> is honored. It is the job of an implementation of a Transport Services System to turn the requests of an application into decisions on how to establish connections and how to transfer data over those connections once established. The terminology used in this document is based on the terminology defined in the Transport Services Architecture <xref target="RFC9621" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9621"/>.</t>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">Preconnection objects should be implemented as bundles of Properties that an application can both read and write. A Preconnection object influences a Connection only at one point in time: when the Connection is created. Connection objects represent the interface between the application and the implementation to manage transport state and conduct data transfer. During the process of establishment (<xref target="conn-establish" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>), the Connection will not necessarily be immediately bound to a transport protocol instance, since multiple candidate Protocol Stacks might be raced.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4">Once a Preconnection has been used to create an outbound Connection or a Listener, the implementation should ensure that the copy of the Properties held by the Connection or Listener cannot be mutated by the application making changes to the original Preconnection object. This may involve the implementation performing a deep-copy, copying the object with all the objects that it references.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-5">Once the Connection is established, the Transport Services Implementation maps actions and events to the details of the chosen Protocol Stack. For example, the same Connection object may ultimately represent a single transport protocol instance (e.g., a TCP connection, a TLS session over TCP, a UDP flow with fully specified Local and Remote Endpoint Identifiers, a DTLS session, a Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) stream, a QUIC stream, or an HTTP/2 stream).
The Connection Properties held by a Connection or Listener are independent of other Connections that are not part of the same Connection Group.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-6">Connection establishment is only a local operation for connectionless protocols, which serves to simplify the local send/receive functions and to filter the traffic for the specified addresses and ports <xref target="RFC8085" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8085"/> (for example, using UDP or UDP-Lite transport without a connection handshake procedure).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-7">Once <tt>Initiate</tt> has been called, the Selection Properties and Endpoint information of the created Connection are immutable (i.e., an application is not able to later modify the Properties of a Connection by manipulating the original Preconnection object).
Listener objects are created with a Preconnection, at which point their configuration should be considered immutable by the implementation. The process of listening is described in <xref target="listen" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.7"/>.</t>

A violation that occurs at any of the policy layers should cause a protocol or path to be considered ineligible for use. If such a violation prevents a Connection from being established, this should be communicated to the application, e.g., via the <tt>EstablishmentError</tt> event. For an example of application preferences leading to constraints, an application may prohibit the use of metered network interfaces for a given Connection to avoid user cost. Similarly, the System Policy at a given time may prohibit the use of such a metered network interface from the application's process. Lastly, the implementation itself may default to disallowing certain network interfaces unless explicitly requested by the application.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-4">It is expected that the database of system policies and the method of looking up these policies will vary across various platforms. An implementation should attempt to look up the relevant policies for the system in a dynamic way to make sure it reflects an accurate version of the System Policy, since the system's policy regarding the application's traffic may change over time due to user or administrative changes.</t>

For example, when connecting on an IP network, a connection attempt to a hostname and port is underspecified because the connection attempt requires a resolved IP address as its Remote Endpoint Identifier. In this case, the node represented by the connection attempt to the hostname is a parent node with child nodes for each IP address.

The root node (or parent node) of the tree will be represented by a single integer, such as "1".

Each child of that node will have an integer that identifies it, from 1 to the number of children.

Branching between paths is the first in the list because results across multiple interfaces are likely not related to one another: endpoint resolution may return different results, especially when using locally resolved host and service names and the protocols that are supported and preferred may differ across interfaces. Thus, if multiple paths are attempted, the overall Connection establishment process can be seen as a race between the available paths or interfaces.</t>

Whether or not a set of protocols, or protocol-specific options, can successfully connect is generally not dependent on which specific IP address is used. Furthermore, the Protocol Stacks being attempted may influence or altogether change the Endpoint Identifiers being used. Adding a proxy to a connection's branch will change the Endpoint Identifier to the proxy's IP address or hostname. Choosing an alternate protocol may also modify the ports that should be selected.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.2-6">Branching for derived endpoints is the final step and may have multiple layers of derivation or resolution, such as DNS service resolution and DNS hostname resolution.</t>

Then, branches with SCTP will be attempted within their subtree according to the Properties influencing protocol selection. However, if the implementation has current cache information that SCTP is not available on the path over Wi-Fi, there would be no SCTP node in the Wi-Fi subtree. Here, the path over Wi-Fi will be attempted first, and, if connection establishment succeeds, TCP will be used. Thus, the Selection Property preferring Wi-Fi takes precedence over the Property that led to a preference for SCTP.</t>

If Selection Properties contain any prohibited Properties, the implementation should first purge branches containing nodes with these Properties.

If the only protocol being used is a transport protocol with a clear handshake, like TCP, then the obvious choice is to declare that node "connected" when the three-way handshake completes. If the only protocol being used is a connectionless protocol, like UDP, the implementation may consider the node fully "connected" the moment it determines a route is present, before sending any packets on the network, see further in <xref target="connectionless-racing" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.6"/>.</t>

If the Protocol Stack involves both TLS and TCP, an implementation could determine that a leaf node is connected after the TCP handshake is complete, or it can wait for the TLS handshake to complete as well. The benefit of declaring completion when the TCP handshake finishes, and thus stopping the race for other branches of the tree, is reduced burden on the network and Remote Endpoints from further connection attempts that are likely to be abandoned. On the other hand, by waiting until the TLS handshake is complete, an implementation avoids the scenario in which a TCP handshake completes quickly, but TLS negotiation is either very slow or fails altogether in particular network conditions or to a particular endpoint. To avoid the issue of TLS possibly failing, the implementation should not generate a <tt>Ready</tt> event for the Connection until the TLS handshake is complete.</t>

The main difference with receiving is that the size and boundaries of the Message are not known beforehand. The application can communicate the parameters for the Message in its <tt>Receive</tt> action, which can help the Transport Services Implementation know how much data to deliver and when. For example, if the application only wants to receive a complete Message, the implementation should wait until an entire Message (datagram, stream, or frame) is read before delivering any Message content to the application. This requires the implementation to understand where Messages end, either via a supplied Message Framer or because the top-level protocol in the established Protocol Stack preserves Message boundaries.

This approach is referred to as sending Zero-RTT (0-RTT) data. This is a desirable feature, but it poses challenges to an implementation that uses racing during Connection establishment.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.3-2">The application can express its preference for sending Messages as 0-RTT data by using the <tt>zeroRttMsg</tt> Selection Property on the Preconnection. Then, the application can provide the Message to send as 0-RTT data via the <tt>InitiateWithSend</tt> action. In order to be sent as 0-RTT data, the Message needs to be marked with the <tt>safelyReplayable</tt> Property. In general, 0-RTT data may be replayed (for example, if a TCP SYN contains data, and the SYN is retransmitted, the data will be retransmitted as well but may be considered a new connection instead of a retransmission). When racing connections, different leaf nodes have the opportunity to send the same data independently. If data is truly safely replayable, this is permissible.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.3-3">Once the application has provided its 0-RTT data, a Transport Services Implementation should keep a copy of this data and provide it to each new leaf node that is started and for which a protocol instance supporting 0-RTT is being used. Note that the amount of data that can actually be sent as 0-RTT data varies by protocol, so any given Protocol Stack might only consume part of the saved data prior to becoming established. The implementation needs to keep track of how much data a particular Protocol Stack has consumed and ensure that any pending 0-RTT-eligible data from the application is handled before subsequent Messages.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.3-4">It is also possible for Protocol Stacks within a particular leaf node to use a 0-RTT handshake in a lower-level protocol without any safely replayable application data if a higher-level protocol in the stack has idempotent handshake data to send. For example, TFO could use a Client Hello from TLS as its 0-RTT data without any data being provided by the application.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.3-5">0-RTT handshakes often rely on previous state, such as TFO cookies, previously established TLS tickets, or out-of-band distributed pre-shared keys (PSKs). Implementations should be aware of security concerns around using these tokens across multiple addresses or paths when racing. In the case of TLS, any given ticket or PSK should only be used on one leaf node, since servers will likely reject duplicate tickets in order to prevent replays (see <xref section="8.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8446" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-8.1" derivedContent="RFC8446"/>). If implementations have multiple tickets available from a previous connection, each leaf node attempt can use a different ticket. In effect, each leaf node will send the same early application data, but the data will be encoded (encrypted) differently on the wire.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">Message Framers are functions that define
simple transformations between application Message data and raw transport
protocol data. Generally, a Message Framer implements a simple
application protocol that can be provided either by the Transport Services
implementation or by the application. It is optional for Transport Services Implementations to provide Message Framers: the API specification <xref target="RFC9622" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9622"/> does not prescribe any particular Message Framers to be implemented.
A Framer can encapsulate or encode outbound Messages,
decapsulate or decode inbound data into Messages, and implement parts of
protocols that do not directly map to application Messages (such as
protocol handshakes or preludes before Message exchange).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-2">While many protocols can be represented as Message Framers, for the
purposes of the Transport Services API, these are ways for applications
or application frameworks to define their own Message parsing to be
included within a Connection's Protocol Stack. As an example, TLS
is a protocol that is by default built into the Transport Services
API, even though it could also serve the purpose of framing data over TCP.</t>

This is in contrast to Connection Groups, which explicitly expose combined treatment of Connections, giving the application control over multiplexing, for example.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-2">Pooled Connections can be useful when the application using the Transport Services System implements a protocol such as HTTP, which employs request/response pairs and does not require in-order delivery of responses.
This enables implementations of Transport Services Systems to realize transparent connection coalescing and connection migration and to perform per-Message endpoint and path selection by choosing among multiple underlying connections.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-1">When a path change occurs, e.g., when the IP address of an interface changes or a new interface becomes available, the Transport Services Implementation is responsible for notifying the protocol instance of the change. The path change may interrupt connectivity on a path for an active Connection or provide an opportunity for a transport that supports multipath or migration to adapt to the new paths. Note that, in the model of the Transport Services API, migration is considered a part of multipath connectivity; it is just a limiting policy on multipath usage. If the <tt>multipath</tt> Selection Property is set to <tt>Disabled</tt>, migration is disallowed.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-2">For protocols that do not support multipath or migration, the protocol instances should be informed of the path change but should not be forcibly disconnected if the previously used path becomes unavailable. There are many common usage scenarios that can lead to a path becoming temporarily unavailable and then recovering before the transport protocol reaches a timeout error. These are particularly common using mobile devices. Examples include:</t>
        <ul bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" spacing="normal" pn="section-7.2-3">
          <li pn="section-7.2-3.1">an Ethernet cable becoming unplugged and then plugged back in;</li>

          <li pn="section-7.2-3.3">a user losing the radio signal while riding a train through a tunnel.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-4">If the device is able to rejoin a network with the same IP address, a stateful transport connection can generally resume. Thus, while it is useful for a protocol instance to be aware of a temporary loss of connectivity, the Transport Services Implementation should not aggressively close Connections in these scenarios.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-5">If the Protocol Stack includes a transport protocol that supports multipath connectivity, the Transport Services Implementation should also inform the protocol instance about potentially new paths that become permissible based on the <tt>multipath</tt> Selection Property and the <tt>multipathPolicy</tt> Connection Property choices made by the application.
A protocol can then establish new subflows over new paths while an
  active path is still available or
  after a break has been detected, and it should attempt to tear down
  subflows over paths that are no longer used. The Connection Property <tt>multipathPolicy</tt> of the Transport Services API
allows an application to indicate when and how different paths should be used. However, detailed handling of these policies is implementation specific.
For example, if the <tt>multipath</tt> Selection Property is set to <tt>Active</tt>, the decision about when to create a new path or to announce a new path or set of paths to the Remote Endpoint, e.g., in the form of additional IP addresses, is implementation specific.
If the Protocol Stack includes a transport protocol that does not support multipath but does support migrating between paths, the update to the set of available paths can trigger the connection to be migrated.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-6">In the case of a Pooled Connection (<xref target="pooled-connections" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.1"/>), the Transport Services Implementation may add connections over new paths to the pool if permissible based on the <tt>multipathPolicy</tt> and Selection Properties.
If a previously used path becomes unavailable, the Transport Services System may disconnect all connections that require this path, but it should not disconnect the Pooled Connection object exposed to the application.
The strategy to do so is implementation specific, but it should be consistent with the behavior of multipath transports.</t>

            <t indent="0" pn="section-10.6-1.6.1">Connection objects can be mapped to an SCTP association or a stream in an SCTP association. Mapping Connection objects to SCTP streams is called "stream mapping" and has additional requirements as follows. The following explanation assumes a client-server communication model.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-10.6-1.6.2">Stream mapping requires an association to already be in place between the client and the server, and it requires the server to understand that a new incoming stream should be represented as a new Connection object by the Transport Services System. A new SCTP stream is created by sending an SCTP message with a new stream id. Thus, to implement stream mapping, the Transport Services API must provide a newly created Connection object to the application upon the reception of such a message. The necessary semantics to implement a Transport Services System's <tt>Close</tt> and <tt>Abort</tt> primitives are provided by the stream reconfiguration (reset) procedure described in <xref target="RFC6525" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6525"/>. This also allows a stream id to be reused after resetting ("closing") the stream. To implement this functionality, SCTP stream reconfiguration <xref target="RFC6525" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6525"/> must be supported by both the client and the server side.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-10.6-1.6.3">To avoid head-of-line blocking, stream mapping should only be implemented when both sides support message interleaving <xref target="RFC8260" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8260"/>. This allows a sender to schedule transmissions between multiple streams without risking that transmission of a large message on one stream will block transmissions on other streams for a long time.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-10.6-1.6.4">To avoid conflicts between stream ids, the following procedure is recommended: the first Connection, for which the SCTP association has been created, must always use stream id zero. All additional Connections are assigned to unused stream ids in ascending order. To avoid a conflict when both endpoints map new Connections simultaneously, the peer that initiated association must use even stream ids whereas the remote side must map its Connections to odd stream ids. Both sides maintain a status map of the assigned stream ids. Generally, new streams should consume the lowest available (even or odd, depending on the side) stream id; this rule is relevant when lower stream ids become available because Connection objects associated with the streams are closed.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-10.6-1.6.5">SCTP stream mapping as described here has been implemented in a research prototype; a description of this implementation is given in <xref target="NEAT-flow-mapping" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NEAT-flow-mapping"/>.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes an experimental TCP mechanism called TCP Fast Open (TFO). TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged. However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances. Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section.</t>

              <t indent="0">Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of which may have different performance and connectivity characteristics. Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4 or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of establishing a connection more quickly. This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an example algorithm, referred to as "Happy Eyeballs". This document obsoletes the original algorithm description in RFC 6555.</t>

              <t indent="0">Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) want the ability to "reset" a stream. The intention of resetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application layer that the reset has been performed. Applications requiring this feature want it so that they can "reuse" streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application can track the message flows. Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to "reset the streams back to zero". This document also includes methods for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful.</t>

Diffserv is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different Diffserv Codepoints (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. The results of using multiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple have transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This memo covers the implications of these Diffserv aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC.</t>

SVCB records allow a service to be provided from multiple alternative endpoints, each with associated parameters (such as transport protocol configuration), and are extensible to support future uses (such as keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello). They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME. The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for use with HTTP (see RFC 9110, "HTTP Semantics"). By providing more information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy.</t>
