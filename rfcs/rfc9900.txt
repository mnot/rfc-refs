               Updates to NETCONF Transport Port Numbers

Abstract

   This document releases IANA-assigned port numbers for services
   related to the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) that have not
   been in use in production networks.

1.  Introduction

   The "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry"
   [IANA-SERVICE] records several NETCONF-related port and service name
   assignments such as 830 for NETCONF over Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242], 831 for NETCONF over the Blocks Extensible Exchange
   Protocol (BEEP) [RFC4744], 832 for NETCONF over the Simple Object
   Access Protocol (SOAP) [RFC4743], 4334 for NETCONF Call Home
   [RFC8071], and 6513 for NETCONF over Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC7589][NETCONF-over-TLS].

   However, three of these assignments (831, 832, and 833) are for
   protocols that are not deployed, and the relevant RFCs ([RFC4743] and
   [RFC4744]) have been marked Historic.  All these assignments are thus
   no longer required to support these services.

   This document de-assigns these unused port numbers.

   Consistent with Section 8.2 of [RFC6335], this document does not de-
   assign service names; only port numbers are de-assigned for better
   usage of available scarce resources.

2.  Operational Considerations

   There are no known implementations and deployments of protocols that
   rely upon the port numbers released back by this document.

   Existing configurations (if any) that associate the released port
   numbers with the service names "netconf-beep" and "netconfsoaphttp"
   need to be reassessed and updated according to the actions in
   Section 4.

   Other than that, there are no new operations or manageability
   requirements introduced by this document.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not describe any protocol.  As such, this document
   does not introduce any new security vulnerability.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has updated the "Service Name and Transport
   Protocol Port Number Registry" [IANA-SERVICE] as specified in the
   following subsections.

   De-assigned allocations are marked per Section 8.2 of [RFC6335].
   These actions are not repeated here.

4.1.  NETCONF over BEEP Service
