1.  Introduction

   This document instructs IANA to make changes to a number of the IANA
   registries related to Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  These changes update the changes
   made in [RFC8447].

   This specification adds a new value, "D" for discouraged, to the
   "Recommended" column of the selected TLS registries and adds a
   "Comment" column to all active registries that do not already have a
   "Comment" column.

   This specification also updates the registration request
   instructions.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updating "Recommended" Column's Values

   The instructions in this document update the "Recommended" column,
   originally added in [RFC8447] to add a third value, "D", indicating
   that a value is discouraged.  The permitted values of the
   "Recommended" column are:

   Y:  Indicates that the IETF has consensus that the item is
      RECOMMENDED.  This only means that the associated mechanism is fit
      for the purpose for which it was defined.  Careful reading of the
      documentation for the mechanism is necessary to understand the
      applicability of that mechanism.  The IETF could recommend
      mechanisms that have limited applicability but will provide
      applicability statements that describe any limitations of the
      mechanism or necessary constraints on its use.

   N:  Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and
      that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the
      associated mechanism.  This does not necessarily mean that the
      mechanism is flawed, only that no consensus exists.  The IETF
      might have consensus to leave an item marked as "N" on the basis
      of the item having limited applicability or usage constraints.

   D:  Indicates that the item is discouraged.  This marking could be
      used to identify mechanisms that might result in problems if they
      are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism
      that might cause interoperability problems in deployment.  When
      marking a registry entry as "D", either the "Reference" or the
      "Comment" column MUST include sufficient information to determine
      why the marking has been applied.  Implementers and users SHOULD
      consult the linked references associated with the item to
      determine the conditions under which the item SHOULD NOT or MUST
      NOT be used.

   Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y" or
   "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action with
   Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].  Not all items defined in
   Standards Track RFCs need to be set to "Y" or "D".  Any item not
   otherwise specified is set to "N".  The column is blank for values
   that are unassigned or reserved unless specifically set.

3.1.  Recommended Note

   Existing registries have a note on the meaning of the "Recommended"
   column.  For the registries discussed in the subsequent sections,
   this note is updated with a sentence describing the "D" value as
   follows:

   |  Note: If the "Recommended" column is set to "N", it does not
   |  necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
   |  item has not been through the IETF consensus process, has limited
   |  applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.  If the
   |  "Recommended" column is set to "D", the item is discouraged and
   |  SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used, depending upon the situation;
   |  consult the item's references for clarity.

4.  TLS ExtensionType Values Registry

   In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended" column
   allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS ExtensionType Values" registry
   as follows:

   *  Adjusted the registration procedure related to setting the
      "Recommended" column as follows:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Added a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Updated the "Recommended" column with the changes listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in the following table.  IANA has added a reference to
      this document for these entries.

           +=======+============================+=============+
           | Value | Extension Name             | Recommended |
           +=======+============================+=============+
           | 4     | truncated_hmac             |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 40    | Reserved                   |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 46    | Reserved                   |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 53    | connection_id (deprecated) |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+

                                 Table 1

   *  Updated the note on the "Recommended" column with text in
      Section 3.1.

   *  For the truncated_hmac, added the following link to the
      "Reference" column: https://www.iacr.org/archive/
      asiacrypt2011/70730368/70730368.pdf.

   *  For the two Reserved values above, added the following link in the
      "Reference" column: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls-reg-
      review/5BD62HBFjo_AsW-Y8ohVuWEe1gI/.

5.  TLS Cipher Suites Registry

   Several categories of cipher suites are discouraged for general use
   and are marked as "D".

   Cipher suites that use NULL encryption do not provide the
   confidentiality normally expected of TLS.  Protocols and applications
   are often designed to require confidentiality as a security property.
   These cipher suites MUST NOT be used in those cases.

   Cipher suites marked as EXPORT use weak ciphers and were deprecated
   in TLS 1.1 [RFC4346].

   Cipher suites marked as anon do not provide any authentication, are
   vulnerable to on-path attacks, and were deprecated in TLS 1.1
   [RFC4346].

   RC4 is a weak cipher and is deprecated in [RFC7465].

   DES and the International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) are not
   considered secure for general use and were deprecated in [RFC5469].
   MD5 and SHA-1 are also not secure for general use and were deprecated
   in [RFC9155].

   In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended" column
   allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS Cipher Suites" registry as
   follows:

   *  Adjusted the registration procedure related to setting the
      "Recommended" column as follows:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Added a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Updated the "Recommended" column with the changes listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in following table.  IANA has added a reference to this
      document for these entries.  This document does not make any
      changes to the "DTLS-OK" column.

                                  Table 2

   *  Updated the note on the "Recommended" column with text in
      Section 3.1.

6.  TLS Supported Groups Registry

   In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended" column
   allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS Supported Groups" registry as
   follows:

   *  Updated the registration policy to include:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Added a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Updated the "Recommended" column with the changes listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in following table.  IANA has added a reference to this
      document for these entries.

                                  Table 3

   *  Updated the note on the "Recommended" column with text in
      Section 3.1.

   *  Removed the "Elliptic curve groups" note from the registration
      procedures table.

   *  For each of the entries above, added the following link to the
      "Comment" column:
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/118/materials/slides-118-tls-
      rfc8447bis-00.

7.  TLS Exporter Labels Registry

   This document updates the registration procedure for the "TLS
   Exporter Labels" registry and updates the "Recommended" column
   allocation.  IANA has updated the "TLS Exporter Labels" registry as
   follows:

   *  Changed the registration procedure from Specification Required to
      Expert Review and updated it to include:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Added a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Entries kept their existing "Recommended" column "Y" and "N"
      entries.

   *  Updated the note on the "Recommended" column with text in
      Section 3.1.

   *  Updated the note on the role of the expert reviewer as follows.

   |  Note: The role of the designated expert is described in Section 17
   |  of [RFC8447].  Even though this registry does not require a
   |  specification, the designated expert [RFC8126] will strongly
   |  encourage registrants to provide a link to a publicly available
   |  specification.  An Internet-Draft (that is posted and never
   |  published as an RFC) or a document from another standards body,
   |  industry consortium, university site, etc. is suitable for these
   |  purposes.  The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their
   |  approval should not be taken as an endorsement of the exporter
   |  label.  The expert also verifies that the label is a string
   |  consisting of printable ASCII characters beginning with
   |  "EXPORTER".  IANA MUST also verify that one label is not a prefix
   |  of any other label.  For example, labels "key" or "master
   |  secretary" are forbidden.

   *  Renamed the "Note" column to "Comment".

8.  TLS Certificate Types Registry

   In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended" column
   allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS Certificate Types" registry as
   follows:

   *  Adjusted the registration procedure related to setting the
      "Recommended" column as follows:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Added a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Entries kept their existing "Recommended" column "Y" and "N"
      entries.

   *  Updated the note on the "Recommended" column with text in
      Section 3.1.

9.  TLS HashAlgorithm Registry

   TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 were deprecated [RFC8996]; TLS 1.2 will be in use
   for some time.  In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended"
   column allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS HashAlgorithm" registry
   as follows:

   *  Updated the registration procedure to include:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Added a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Updated the "TLS HashAlgorithm" registry to add a "Recommended"
      column as follows:

                   +=======+=============+=============+
                   | Value | Description | Recommended |
                   +=======+=============+=============+
                   | 0     | none        |           Y |

10.  TLS SignatureAlgorithm Registry

   TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 were deprecated [RFC8996], TLS 1.2 will be in use
   for some time.  In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended"
   column allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS SignatureAlgorithm"
   registry as follows:

   *  Updated the registration procedure to include:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Added a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Updated the "TLS SignatureAlgorithm" registry to add a
      "Recommended" column as follows:

   In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended" column
   allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS PskKeyExchangeMode" registry as
   follows:

   *  Updated the registration procedure to include:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action
      with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

13.  TLS SignatureScheme Registry

   In order to reflect the changes in the "Recommended" column
   allocation, IANA has updated the "TLS SignatureScheme" registry as
   follows:

   *  Updated the registration procedure to include:

      Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y"
      or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action

15.  Expert Review of Current and Potential IETF and IRTF Documents

   The intent of the Specification Required choice for TLS codepoints is
   to allow for easy registration for codepoints associated with
   protocols and algorithms that are not being actively developed inside
   the IETF or IRTF.  When TLS-based technologies are being developed
   inside the IETF or IRTF, they should be done in coordination with the
   TLS WG in order to provide appropriate review.  For this reason,
   unless the TLS WG Chairs indicate otherwise via email, designated
   experts should decline codepoint registrations for documents that
   have already been adopted or are being proposed for adoption by IETF
   working groups or IRTF research groups.

16.  Registration Requests

   Registration requests MUST be submitted in one of two ways:

   1.  By sending email to iana@iana.org; this email SHOULD use an
       appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register value in TLS bar
       registry").

   2.  Using the online form at https://www.iana.org/form/protocol-
       assignment.

   Specification Required [RFC8126] registry requests are registered
   after a three-week review period on the advice of one or more
   designated experts.  However, to allow for the allocation of values
   prior to publication, the designated experts may approve registration
   once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.

17.  Security Considerations

   Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general use at the
   time of registration; however, cryptographic algorithms and
   parameters will be broken or weakened over time.  It is possible that
   the "Recommended" status in the registry lags behind the most recent
   advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users need to check that
   the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the expected
   level of security.

   Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available.
   They may provide more in-depth reviews.  Their review should not be
   taken as an endorsement of the cipher suite, extension, supported
   group, etc.

18.  IANA Considerations

   This document is entirely about changes to TLS-related IANA
   registries.
