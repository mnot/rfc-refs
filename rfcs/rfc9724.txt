State of Affairs for Randomized and Changing Media Access Control (MAC)
                               Addresses

Abstract

   Internet users are becoming more aware that their activity over the
   Internet leaves a vast digital footprint, that communications might
   not always be properly secured, and that their location and actions
   can be tracked.  One of the main factors that eases tracking of
   Internet users is the wide use of long-lasting, and sometimes
   persistent, identifiers at various protocol layers.  This document
   focuses on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.

   There have been several initiatives within the IETF and the IEEE 802
   standards committees to address some of the privacy issues involved.
   This document provides an overview of these activities to help
   coordinate standardization activities in these bodies.

1.  Introduction

   Privacy is becoming a huge concern, as more and more devices are
   connecting to the Internet either directly (e.g., via Wi-Fi) or
   indirectly (e.g., via a smartphone using Bluetooth).  This ubiquitous
   connectivity, together with the lack of proper education about
   privacy, makes it very easy to track/monitor the location of users
   and/or eavesdrop on their physical and online activities.  This is
   due to many factors, such as the vast digital footprint that users
   leave on the Internet with or without their consent and the weak (or
   even null) authentication and encryption mechanisms used to secure
   communications.  A digital footprint may include information shared
   on social networks, cookies used by browsers and servers for various
   reasons, connectivity logs that allow tracking of a user's Layer 2
   (L2) address (i.e., MAC address) or Layer 3 (L3) address, web
   trackers, etc.

   Privacy concerns affect all layers of the protocol stack, from the
   lower layers involved in the access to the network (e.g., MAC/L2 and
   L3 addresses can be used to obtain the location of a user) to higher-
   layer protocol identifiers and user applications [CSCN2015].  In
   particular, IEEE 802 MAC addresses have historically been an easy
   target for tracking users [wifi_tracking].

   There have been several initiatives within the IETF and the IEEE 802
   standards committees to address some of these privacy issues.  This
   document provides an overview of these activities to help coordinate
   standardization activities within these bodies.

2.  Background

2.1.  MAC Address Usage

   Most mobile devices used today are Wi-Fi enabled (i.e., they are
   equipped with an IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network interface).
   Like any other kind of network interface based on IEEE 802 such as
   Ethernet (i.e., IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi interfaces have an L2 address
   (also referred to as a MAC address) that can be seen by anybody who
   can receive the radio signal transmitted by the network interface.
   The format of these addresses (for 48-bit MAC addresses) is shown in
   Figure 1.

           +--------+--------+---------+--------+--------+---------+
           |  Organizationally Unique  |     Network Interface     |
           |     Identifier (OUI)      | Controller (NIC) Specific |
           +--------+--------+---------+--------+--------+---------+
          /          \
         /            \
        /              \          b0 (I/G bit):
       /                \             0: unicast
      /                  \            1: multicast
     /                    \
    /                      \      b1 (U/L bit):
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+          0: globally unique (OUI enforced)
   |b7|b6|b5|b4|b3|b2|b1|b0|          1: locally administered
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

        Figure 1: IEEE 802 MAC Address Format (for 48-Bit Addresses)

   MAC addresses can be either universally or locally administered.
   Universally and locally administered addresses are distinguished by
   setting the second least significant bit of the most significant byte
   of the address (the U/L bit).

   A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device
   by its manufacturer.  Most physical devices are provided with a
   universally administered address, which is composed of two parts:

   Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI):  The first three octets in
      transmission order, which identify the organization that issued
      the identifier.

   Network Interface Controller (NIC) Specific:  The following three
      octets, which are assigned by the organization that manufactured
      the NIC, in such a way that the resulting MAC address is globally
      unique.

   Locally administered addresses override the burned-in address, and
   they can be set up by either the network administrator or the
   Operating System (OS) of the device to which the address pertains.
   However, as explained in later sections of this document, there are
   new initiatives in the IEEE 802 and other organizations to specify
   ways in which these locally administered addresses should be
   assigned, depending on the use case.

2.2.  MAC Address Randomization

   Since universally administered MAC addresses are by definition
   globally unique, when a device uses this MAC address over a shared
   medium to transmit data -- especially over the air -- it is
   relatively easy to track this device by simple medium observation.
   Since a device is usually directly associated to an individual, this
   poses a privacy concern [link_layer_privacy].

   MAC addresses can be easily observed by a third party, such as a
   passive device listening to communications in the same L2 network.
   In an 802.11 network, a device (also known as an IEEE 802.11 station
   or STA) exposes its MAC address in two different situations:

   *  While actively scanning for available networks, the MAC address is
      used in the Probe Request frames sent by the device.

   *  Once associated to a given Access Point (AP), the MAC address is
      used in frame transmission and reception, as one of the addresses
      used in the unicast address fields of an IEEE 802.11 frame.

   One way to address this privacy concern is by using randomly
   generated MAC addresses.  IEEE 802 addressing includes one bit to
   specify if the hardware address is locally or globally administered.
   This allows local addresses to be generated without the need for any
   global coordination mechanism to ensure that the generated address is
   still unique within the local network.  This feature can be used to
   generate random addresses, which decouple the globally unique
   identifier from the device and therefore make it more difficult to
   track a user device from its MAC/L2 address
   [enhancing_location_privacy].

   Note that there are reports [contact_tracing_paper] of some mobile
   OSes reporting persistently (every 20 minutes or so) on MAC addresses
   (as well as other information), which would defeat MAC address
   randomization.  While these practices might have changed by now, it
   is important to highlight that privacy-preserving techniques should
   be conducted while considering all layers of the protocol stack.

2.3.  Privacy Workshop, Tutorial, and Experiments at IETF and IEEE 802
      Meetings

   As an outcome to the STRINT W3C/IAB Workshop [strint], a tutorial
   titled "Pervasive Surveillance of the Internet - Designing Privacy
   into Internet Protocols" [privacy_tutorial] was given at the IEEE 802
   Plenary meeting in San Diego in July of 2014.  The tutorial provided
   an update on the recent developments regarding Internet privacy, the
   actions undertaken by other Standards Development Organizations
   (SDOs) like the IETF, and guidelines that were being followed when
   developing new Internet protocol specifications (e.g., the
   considerations described in [RFC6973]).  The tutorial highlighted
   some privacy concerns that apply specifically to link-layer
   technologies and provided suggestions on how IEEE 802 could help
   address them.

   Following the discussions and interest within the IEEE 802 community,
   on 18 July 2014, the IEEE 802 Executive Committee (EC) created the
   IEEE 802 EC Privacy Recommendation Study Group (SG)
   [ieee_privacy_ecsg].  The work and discussions from the group have
   generated multiple outcomes, such Project Authorization Requests
   (PARs) that resulted in the following documents:

   *  "IEEE Recommended Practice for Privacy Considerations for IEEE
      802(R) Technologies" [IEEE_802E]

   *  "IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks: Overview
      and Architecture - Amendment 2: Local Medium Access Control (MAC)
      Address Usage" [IEEE_802c]

   In order to test the effects of MAC address randomization,
   experiments were conducted at the IETF and IEEE 802 meetings between
   November 2014 and March 2015 -- IETF 91, IETF 92, and the IEEE 802
   Plenary in Berlin.  The purpose of the experiments was to evaluate
   the use of MAC address randomization from two different perspectives:
   (1) the effect on the connectivity experience of the end user, as
   well as any effect on applications and OSes, and (2) the potential
   impact on the network infrastructure itself.  Some of the findings
   were published in [CSCN2015].

   During the experiments, it was observed that the probability of
   address duplication in a network is negligible.  The experiments also
   revealed that other protocol identifiers (e.g., the DHCP client
   identifier) can be correlated and can therefore still be used to
   track an individual.  Hence, effective privacy tools should not work
   in isolation at a single layer; instead; they should be coordinated
   with other privacy features at higher layers.

   Since then, MAC address randomization has been further implemented by
   mobile OSes to provide better privacy for mobile phone users when
   connecting to public wireless networks [privacy_ios]
   [privacy_windows] [privacy_android].

3.  Activities Relating to Randomized and Changing MAC Addresses in the
    IEEE 802

   Practical experiences with Randomized and Changing MAC addresses
   (RCM) in devices (some of which are explained in Section 6) helped
   researchers fine-tune their understanding of attacks against
   randomization mechanisms [when_mac_randomization_fails].  Within the
   IEEE 802.11 group, these research experiences eventually formed the
   basis for a specified mechanism that randomizes MAC addresses, which
   was introduced in IEEE Std 802.11aq [IEEE_802.11aq] in 2018.

   More recent developments include turning on MAC address randomization
   in mobile OSes by default, which has an impact on the ability of
   network operators to customize services [rcm_user_experience_csd].
   Therefore, follow-on work in the IEEE 802.11 mapped effects of a
   potentially large uptake of randomized MAC identifiers on a number of
   commonly offered operator services in 2019 [rcm_tig_final_report].
   In the summer of 2020, this work emanated in two new standards
   projects.  The purpose of these projects was to develop mechanisms
   that do not decrease user privacy but enable an optimal user
   experience when (1) the MAC address of a device in an Extended
   Service Set (a group of interconnected IEEE 802.11 wireless access
   points and stations that form a single logical network) is randomized
   or changes [rcm_user_experience_par] and (2) user privacy solutions
   described in IEEE Std 802.11 [rcm_privacy_par] apply.

   IEEE Std 802 [IEEE_802], as of the amendment IEEE 802c-2017
   [IEEE_802c], specifies a local MAC address space structure known as
   the Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP) [RFC8948].  The SLAP
   designates a range of Extended Local Identifiers for subassignment
   within a block of addresses assigned by the IEEE Registration
   Authority via a Company ID.  A range of local MAC addresses is
   designated for Standard Assigned Identifiers to be specified by IEEE
   802 standards.  Another range of local MAC addresses is designated
   for Administratively Assigned Identifiers, which are subject to
   assignment by a network administrator.

   IEEE Std 802E-2020 ("IEEE Recommended Practice for Privacy
   Considerations for IEEE 802(R) Technologies") [IEEE_802E] recommends
   the use of temporary and transient identifiers if there are no
   compelling reasons for a newly introduced identifier to be permanent.
   This recommendation is part of the basis for the review of user
   privacy solutions for IEEE Std 802.11 devices (also known as Wi-Fi
   devices) as part of the RCM efforts [rcm_privacy_csd].  Annex I of
   IEEE Std 802.1AEdk-2023 ("MAC Privacy Protection") [IEEE_802.1AEdk]
   discusses privacy considerations in bridged networks.

   As of 2024, two task groups in IEEE 802.11 are dealing with issues
   related to RCM:

   *  The IEEE 802.11bh task group, which is looking at mitigating the
      repercussions that RCM creates on 802.11 networks and related
      services.

   *  The IEEE 802.11bi task group, which is chartered to define
      modifications to the IEEE Std 802.11 MAC specification
      [IEEE_802.11] to specify new mechanisms that address and improve
      user privacy.

4.  Recent Activities Related to MAC Address Randomization in the WBA

   In the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA), the Testing and
   Interoperability Work Group has been looking at issues related to MAC
   address randomization and has identified a list of potential impacts
   of these changes to existing systems and solutions, mainly related to
   Wi-Fi identification.

   As part of this work, the WBA has documented a set of use cases that
   a Wi-Fi Identification Standard should address in order to scale and
   achieve longer-term sustainability of deployed services (see
   [wba_paper]).

5.  IPv6 Address Randomization in the IETF

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6, which typically results in hosts configuring one or more
   "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a local
   router and an Interface Identifier (IID).  [RFC8064] formally updated
   the original IPv6 IID selection mechanism to avoid generating the IID
   from the MAC address of the interface (via EUI64), as this
   potentially allowed for tracking of a device at L3.  Additionally,
   the prefix part of an IP address provides meaningful insights of the
   physical location of the device in general, which together with the
   IID based on the MAC address, made it easier to perform global device
   tracking.

   [RFC8981] identifies and describes the privacy issues associated with
   embedding MAC stable addressing information into IPv6 addresses (as
   part of the IID).  It describes an extension to IPv6 SLAAC that
   causes hosts to generate temporary addresses with randomized IIDs for
   each prefix advertised with autoconfiguration enabled.  Changing
   addresses over time limits the window of time during which
   eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially perform
   address-based network-activity correlation when the same address is
   employed for multiple transactions by the same host.  Additionally,
   it reduces the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via
   an address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication.
   These temporary addresses are meant to be used for a short period of
   time (hours to days) and then deprecated.  Deprecated addresses can
   continue to be used for already-established connections but are not
   used to initiate new connections.  New temporary addresses are
   generated periodically to replace temporary addresses that expire.
   To generate temporary addresses, a node produces a sequence of
   temporary global scope addresses from a sequence of IIDs that appear
   to be random in the sense that (1) it is difficult for an outside
   observer to predict a future address (or identifier) based on a
   current one and (2) it is difficult to determine previous addresses
   (or identifiers) knowing only the present one.  Temporary addresses
   should not be used by applications that listen for incoming
   connections (as these are supposed to be waiting on permanent/well-
   known identifiers).  If a node changes network and comes back to a
   previously visited one, the temporary addresses that the node would
   use will be different, which might be an issue in certain networks
   where addresses are used for operational purposes (e.g., filtering or
   authentication).  [RFC7217], summarized next, partially addresses the
   problems aforementioned.

   [RFC7217] describes a method to generate IIDs that are stable for
   each network interface within each subnet but change as a host moves
   from one network to another.  This method enables the "stability"
   properties of the IIDs specified in [RFC4291] to be kept, while still
   mitigating address-scanning attacks and preventing correlation of the
   activities of a host as it moves from one network to another.  The
   method defined to generate the IPv6 IID is based on computing a hash
   function that takes the following as input: information that is
   stable and associated to the interface (e.g., a local IID), stable
   information associated to the visited network (e.g., the IEEE 802.11
   Service Set Identifier (SSID)), the IPv6 prefix, a secret key, and
   some other additional information.  This basically ensures that a
   different IID is generated when one of the input fields changes (such
   as the network or the prefix) but that the IID is the same within
   each subnet.

   To mitigate the privacy threats posed by the use of MAC-derived IIDs,
   [RFC8064] recommends that nodes implement [RFC7217] as the default
   scheme for generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.

   In addition to the documents above, [RFC8947] proposes a DHCPv6
   extension that:

   |  allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments where
   |  preassigned link-layer address assignments (such as by a
   |  manufacturer) are not possible or are unnecessary.

   And [RFC8948] proposes DHCPv6 extensions that:

   |  enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred
   |  SLAP quadrant to the server so that the server may allocate MAC
   |  addresses in the quadrant requested by the relay or client.

   In addition to MAC and IP addresses, some DHCP options that carry
   unique identifiers can also be used for tracking purposes.  These
   identifiers can enable device tracking even if the device
   administrator takes care of randomizing other potential
   identifications like link-layer addresses or IPv6 addresses.
   [RFC7844] introduces anonymity profiles that are:

   |  designed for clients that wish to remain anonymous to the visited
   |  network

   and that:

   |  provide guidelines on the composition of DHCP or DHCPv6 messages,
   |  designed to minimize disclosure of identifying information.

   [RFC7844] also indicates that the link-layer address, IP address, and
   DHCP identifier shall evolve in synchrony.

6.  Taxonomy of MAC Address Selection Policies

   This section documents different policies for MAC address selection.
   Some OSes might use a combination of multiple policies.

      |  Note: The naming convention for the terms defined in this
      |  section aligns with 802.11/Wi-Fi terminology in that the "A"
      |  for "address" is not included in the acronym.  For example,
      |  "PVOM" stands for "Per-Vendor OUI MAC address", and "PNGM"
      |  stands for "Per-Network Generated MAC address".

6.1.  Per-Vendor OUI MAC Address (PVOM)

   This form of MAC address selection is the historical default.

   The vendor obtains an OUI from the IEEE.  This is a 24-bit prefix
   (including two upper bits that are set specifically) that is assigned
   to the vendor.  The vendor generates a unique 24-bit value for the
   lower 24 bits, forming the 48-bit MAC address.  It is not unusual for
   the 24-bit value to be used as an incrementing counter that was
   assigned at the factory and burnt into non-volatile storage.

   Note that IEEE Std 802.15.4 [IEEE_802.15.4] uses 64-bit MAC
   addresses, and the IEEE assigns 32-bit prefixes.  The IEEE has
   indicated that there may be a future Ethernet specification that uses
   64-bit MAC addresses.

6.2.  Per-Device Generated MAC Address (PDGM)

   This form of MAC address is randomly generated by the device, usually
   upon first boot.  The resulting MAC address is stored in non-volatile
   storage and is used for the rest of the device lifetime.

6.3.  Per-Boot Generated MAC Address (PBGM)

   This form of MAC address is randomly generated by the device each
   time the device is booted.  The resulting MAC address is *not* stored
   in non-volatile storage.  It does not persist across power cycles.
   This case may sometimes be a PDGM where the non-volatile storage is
   no longer functional (or has failed).

6.4.  Per-Network Generated MAC Address (PNGM)

   This form of MAC address is generated each time a new network
   attachment is created.

   This is typically used with Wi-Fi networks (i.e., 802.11 networks)
   where the network is identified by an SSID Name.  The generated
   address is stored in non-volatile storage, indexed by the SSID.  Each
   time the device returns to a network with the same SSID, the device
   uses the saved MAC address.

   It is possible to use PNGM for wired Ethernet connections through
   some passive observation of network traffic (such as spanning tree
   protocols [IEEE_802.1Q], the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)
   [IEEE_802.1AB], DHCP, or Router Advertisements) to determine which
   network has been attached.

6.5.  Per-Period Generated MAC Address (PPGM)

   This form of MAC address is generated periodically, typically around
   every twelve hours.  Like PNGM, it is used primarily with Wi-Fi.

   When the MAC address changes, the station disconnects from the
   current session and reconnects using the new MAC address.  This will
   involve a new 802.1x session, as well as obtaining or refreshing a
   new IP address (e.g., using DHCP or SLAAC).

   If DHCP is used, then a new DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) is
   generated so as to not link to the previous connection; this usually
   results in the allocation of new IP addresses.

6.6.  Per-Session Generated MAC Address (PSGM)

   This form of MAC address is generated on a per-session basis.  How a
   session is defined is implementation-dependent, for example, a
   session might be defined by logging in to a portal, VPN, etc.  Like
   PNGM and PPGM, it is used primarily with Wi-Fi.

   Since the address only changes when a new session is established,
   there is no disconnection/reconnection involved.

7.  OS Current Practices

   By default, most modern OSes (especially mobile ones) do implement
   some MAC address randomization policies.  Since the mechanism and
   policies that OSes implement can evolve with time, the content is
   hosted at <https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/madinas/RFC9724>.  For
   completeness, a snapshot of the content at the time of publication of
   this document is included below.  Note that the extensive testing
   reported in this document was conducted in 2021, but no significant
   changes have been detected at the time of publication of this
   document.

   Table 1 summarizes current practices for Android and iOS at the time
   of writing this document (the original source is available at

        Table 1: Android and iOS MAC Address Randomization Practices

   In September 2021, we performed some additional tests to evaluate how
   OSes that are widely used behave regarding MAC address randomization.
   Table 2 summarizes our findings; the rows in the table show whether
   the OS performs address randomization per network (PNGM according to
   the taxonomy introduced in Section 6), performs address randomization
   per new connection (PSGM), performs address randomization daily (PPGM
   with a period of 24 hours), supports configuration per SSID, supports
   address randomization for scanning, and supports address
   randomization for scanning by default.

            Table 2: Observed Behavior in Different OSes (as of
                              September 2021)

   According to [privacy_android], starting with Android 12, Android
   uses non-persistent randomization in the following situations:

   *  A network suggestion application specifies that non-persistent
      randomization be used for the network (through an API).

   *  The network is an open network that hasn't encountered a captive
      portal, and an internal config option is set to do so (by default,
      it is not).

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.  Security Considerations

   Privacy considerations regarding tracking the location of a user
   through the MAC address of a device are discussed throughout this
   document.  Given the informational nature of this document, no
   protocols/solutions are specified, but the current state of affairs
   is documented.

   Any future specification in this area would need to look into
   security and privacy aspects, such as (but not limited to) the
   following:

   *  Mitigating the problem of location privacy while minimizing the
      impact on upper layers of the protocol stack

   *  Providing the means for network operators to authenticate devices
      and authorize network access, despite the MAC addresses changing
      according some pattern

   *  Providing the means for the device not to use MAC addresses that
      it is not authorized to use or that are currently in use

   A major conclusion of the work in IEEE Std 802E [IEEE_802E] concerned
   the difficulty of defending privacy against adversaries of any
   sophistication.  Individuals can be successfully tracked by
   fingerprinting, using aspects of their communication other than MAC
   addresses or other permanent identifiers.
