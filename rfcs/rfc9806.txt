   Updates to SIP-Based Media Recording (SIPREC) to Correct Metadata
                               Media Type

Abstract

   The SIP-based Media Recording (SIPREC) protocol is defined by both
   "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata" (RFC 7865) and
   "Session Recording Protocol" (RFC 7866).  Unfortunately, both RFCs
   contradict each other regarding how recording metadata is to be
   labeled.  In addition, neither RFC registered the new media type.
   This document updates RFC 7866 to align with RFC 7865 when labeling
   recording metadata and also registers the media type.

1.  Introduction

   The SIP-based Media Recording (SIPREC) protocol is defined by
   [RFC7865] and [RFC7866].  The former specifies the use of
   "application/rs-metadata+xml" when identifying metadata content,
   whereas the latter uses "application/rs-metadata".  Since [RFC7865]
   defines SIPREC metadata, it was identified as normative, and
   [Err7987] was created against [RFC7866] to report the issue.  This
   document resolves the erratum.

   In addition, neither document registered the media type with IANA;
   this document rectifies this gap.

2.  Updates to RFC 7866

   Each instance of the following in [RFC7866]:

   |  application/rs-metadata

   Is replaced with:

   |  application/rs-metadata+xml

3.  Security Considerations

   The updates specified in this memo clarify inconsistencies in
   published documents with regard to identifying recording metadata.
   They do not introduce new security considerations beyond those listed
   in [RFC7866].

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Media Type Registration

   [RFC7865] defines a media type for use with specifying recording
   metadata in XML data.  This media type is to be used when specifying
   recording metadata in SIPREC.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rs-metadata+xml

   Required parameters:  N/A

   Optional parameters:  N/A

   Encoding considerations:  Same as encoding considerations of
      "application/xml" as specified in [RFC7303].

   Security considerations:  N/A

   Interoperability considerations:  Please note that [RFC7866]
      specifies the use of "application/rs-metadata", which has been
      replaced by "application/rs-metadata+xml" in RFC 9806.

   Published specification:  [RFC7865] [RFC9806]

   Applications that use this media type:  Session Recording Clients
      (SRCs) and Session Recording Servers (SRSs).

   Fragment identifier considerations:  N/A

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  N/A
      Magic number(s):  N/A
      File extension(s):  N/A
      Macintosh file type code(s):  N/A

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  IETF
      SIPCORE Working Group (sipcore@ietf.org)

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  There are no restrictions on where this media
      type can be used.
