      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a
	device, its traffic, its location, and its user in IEEE 802 networks,
	client vendors and client OS vendors have started implementing Media Access
	Control (MAC) address randomization. This technology is particularly
	important in Wi-Fi networks (defined in IEEE 802.11) due to the
	over-the-air medium and device mobility. When such randomization
	happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network
	connectivity and user experience.  At the same time, devices may
	continue using other stable identifiers, defeating the purpose of MAC
	address randomization.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">This document lists various network environments and a range of
        network services that may be affected by such randomization. This
        document then examines settings where the user experience may be
        affected by in-network state disruption. Last, this document examines
        some existing frameworks that maintain user privacy while preserving

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">When the MAC address was first introduced in <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/>, it was used in wired 
         Ethernet networks <xref target="IEEE_802.3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.3"/>. Due to the nature of
         wired networks, devices were relatively stationary, and the physical connection imposed a boundary that restricted attackers
         from easily accessing the network data. However, <xref target="IEEE_802.11" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.11"/> (Wi-Fi) brought new challenges when it was introduced.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">The flexibility of Wi-Fi technology has revolutionized communications and become the
         preferred, and sometimes the only, technology used by devices such as laptops, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT)
         devices.  Wi-Fi is an over-the-air medium that allows attackers with surveillance equipment to monitor WLAN packets and
         track the activity of WLAN devices. It is also sometimes possible for attackers to monitor the WLAN packets behind the Wi-Fi
         Access Point (AP) over the wired Ethernet. Once the association between a device and its user is made, identifying the 
         device and its activity is sufficient to deduce information about what the user is doing, without the user's consent.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">To reduce the risks of identifying a device only by the MAC address, client OS 
         vendors have started implementing Randomized and Changing MAC addresses (RCM). By randomizing the MAC address,
         it becomes harder to use the MAC address to construct a persistent association between a flow of data packets and a device, 
         assuming no other visible unique identifiers or stable patterns are in use. When individual devices are no longer easily 
         identifiable, it also becomes difficult 
         to associate a series of network packet flows in a prolonged period with a particular individual using one specific device
         if the device randomizes the MAC address governed by the OS privacy policies.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">However, such address changes may affect the user experience and the efficiency of legitimate
         network operations. For a long time, network designers and implementers relied on the assumption that a given machine,
         in a network implementing IEEE 802 technologies <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/>, would be represented by a unique network MAC address that would not
         change over time. When this assumption is broken, network communication may be disrupted.
         For example, sessions established between the end device and the network services may break, and
         packets in transit may suddenly be lost. If multiple clients implement aggressive (e.g., once an hour or shorter) 
         MAC address randomization without coordination with network services, some network services, such as MAC address caching in
         the AP and the upstream Layer 2 switch, may not be able to handle the load, which may result in an unexpected network interruption.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">At the same time, some network services rely on the end station
         (as defined by <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/>) to provide an identifier,
         which can be the MAC address or another value. This document also
         refers to the end station as a "device" or "machine". If the client
         implements MAC address randomization but continues sending the same
         static identifier, then the association between a stable identifier
         and the station continues despite the RCM scheme.  There may be
         environments where such continued association is desirable, but there
         may be others where user privacy has more value than any continuity
         of network service state.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">It is useful for implementations of client and network devices to enumerate services that may be
         affected by RCM and to evaluate possible frameworks to maintain both the quality of user experience
         and network efficiency while RCM happens and user privacy is strengthened. This document
         presents these assessments and recommendations.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7"> Although this document mainly discusses MAC address randomization in Wi-Fi networks <xref target="IEEE_802.11" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.11"/>, 
         the same principles can be easily extended to any IEEE 802 networks <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/>.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">In IEEE 802 <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/> technologies, the Media Access Control (MAC) layer defines rules to
control how a device accesses the shared medium. In a network where a machine can
communicate with one or more other machines, one such rule is that each machine needs to be
identified as either the target destination of a message or the source of a message (and the target
destination of the answer). Initially intended as a 48-bit (6-octet) value in the first versions of IEEE 802, other standards under the IEEE 802 <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/> umbrella allow this address to take an
extended format of 64 bits (8 octets), which enabled a larger number of MAC addresses to coexist
as IEEE 802 technologies became widely adopted.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">Regardless of the address length, different networks have different needs, and several bits of
         the first octet are reserved for specific purposes. In particular, the first bit is used to identify
         the destination address as an individual (bit set to 0) or a group address (bit set to 1). The
         second bit, called the Universal/Local (U/L) address bit, indicates whether the address
         has been assigned by a universal or local administrator. Universally administered addresses have this
         bit set to 0. If this bit is set to 1, the entire address is considered to be locally administered
         (see Clause 8.4 of <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/>).    Note that universally administered MAC addresses are
   required to be registered with the IEEE, while locally administered MAC addresses
   are not.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">The intent of this provision is important for the present document. <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/>
         recognizes that some devices (e.g., smart thermostats) may never change their attachment network 
         and will not need a globally unique MAC address to prevent address collision against any other 
         device in any other network. The U/L bit can be set to signal to the network that the MAC address is intended
         to be locally unique (not globally unique). <xref target="IEEE_802" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802"/>
         did not initially define the MAC address allocation schema when the U/L bit is set to 1. It states the address must 
         be unique in a given broadcast domain (i.e., the space where the MAC addresses of devices are visible to one
         another).</t>

            devices, and as such, they bridge a frame from one medium (e.g.,
            Wi-Fi <xref target="IEEE_802.11" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.11"/>) to another (e.g., Ethernet <xref target="IEEE_802.3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.3"/>).  This means that the MAC address of a wireless
            device often exists on the wire beyond the wireless
            access device.  Devices connected to this wire also implement IEEE 802.3 technologies
            <xref target="IEEE_802.3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.3"/>, and as such, they operate on
            the expectation that each device is associated with a MAC address
            that persists for the duration of continuous exchanges.  For
            example, switches and bridges associate MAC addresses to
            individual ports (so as to know to which port to send a frame
            intended for a particular MAC address).  Similarly, AAA services
            can validate the identity of a device and use the device MAC
            address as the first pointer to the device identity (before
            operating further verification).  Similarly, some networking
            devices offer Layer 2 filtering policies that may rely on the
            connected MAC addresses. IEEE 802.1X-enabled devices <xref target="IEEE_802.1X" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.1X"/> may also selectively put the
            interface in a blocking state until a connecting device is
            authenticated.  These services then use the MAC address as the first
            pointer to the device identity to allow or block data traffic.
            This list is not exhaustive.  Multiple services are defined for Ethernet networks
            <xref target="IEEE_802.3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.3"/>, and multiple services

            <xref target="IEEE_802.3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.3"/>. Wireless access points may
also connect using other mediums (e.g., the Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)
<xref target="DOCSIS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DOCSIS"/>) that implement mechanisms under the umbrella of
the general 802 Standard and therefore expect the unique and
persistent association of a MAC address to a device.</li>

            provide functions and services above the MAC layer.  Some of them
            also operate a MAC layer function. For example, routers provide
            IP forwarding services but rely on the device MAC address to
            create the appropriate frame structure.  Other devices and
            services operate at upper layers but also rely upon the IEEE 802
            principles of unique MAC-to-device mapping.  For example, the Address
            Resolution Protocol (ARP) <xref target="RFC826" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC826"/> and Neighbor Discovery
            Protocol (NDP) <xref target="RFC4861" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4861"/> use a MAC address to create the mapping of
            an IP address to a MAC address for packet forwarding.  If a
            device changes its MAC address without a mechanism to notify the
            Layer 2 switch it is connected to or is the provider of a service
            that expects a stable MAC-to-device mapping, the provider of the
            service and traffic forwarding may be disrupted.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">Different network environments provide different levels of network
         services, from simple to complex.  At its simplest level, a network
         can provide a wireless connecting device with basic IP communication
         service (e.g., DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2131"/> or Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4862"/>) and an ability to connect to the Internet (e.g.,
         DNS service or relay and routing in and out through a local gateway).
         The network can also offer more advanced services, such as managed
         instant messaging service, file storage, printing, and/or local web
         service. Larger and more complex networks can also incorporate more
         advanced services, from AAA to Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) applications. To the network,
         its top priority is to provide the best quality of experience to its
         users. Often the network contains policies that help to make a
         forwarding decision based on the network conditions, the device, and
         the user identity associated to the device.  For example, in a
         hospital private network, the network may contain a policy to give
         highest priority to doctors' Voice-Over-IP packets. In another
         example, an enterprise network may contain a policy to allow
         applications from a group of authenticated devices to use Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/> for congestion and/or Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) <xref target="RFC8837" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8837"/> for classification to signal the network for a
         specific network policy. In this configuration, the network is
         required to associate the data packets to an identity to validate the
         legitimacy of the marking.  Before RCM, many network systems used a
         MAC address as a persistent identity to create an association between
         user and device. After implementing RCM, the association is
         broken.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-1">Wireless access points and controllers use the MAC address to validate the device connection
            context, including protocol capabilities, confirmation that authentication was completed, quality
   of service
            or security profiles, and encryption keying material. Some advanced access points and controllers also include
            upper layer functions whose purpose is covered below. A device changing its MAC address, without
            another recorded device identity, would cause the access point and the controller to lose the
            relation between a connection context and the corresponding device.
            As such, the Layer 2 infrastructure does not know that the device (with its new MAC address)
            is authorized to communicate through the network. The encryption keying material is not identified
            anymore (causing the access point to fail to decrypt the device packets and fail to select the
            right key to send encrypted packets to the device). In short, the entire context needs to be
            rebuilt, and a new session restarted. The time consumed by this procedure breaks any flow that
            needs continuity or short delay between packets on the device (e.g., real-time audio, video,
            AR/VR, etc.). For example, <xref target="IEEE_802.11i" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.11i"/>
            recognizes that a device may leave and rejoin the network
            after a short time window.  As such, the standard suggests that the
            infrastructure should keep the context for a device for a while after
            the device was last seen. The device should maintain the same MAC address in such a scenario.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-2">Some network equipment such as multi-layer routers and Wi-Fi access points, which serve both 
            Layer 2 and Layer 3 in the same device, rely on ARP <xref target="RFC826" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC826"/> and NDP <xref target="RFC4861" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4861"/>
            to build the MAC-to-IP table for packet forwarding. 
            The size of the MAC address cache in the Layer 2 switch is finite. 
            If new entries are created
            faster than the old entries are flushed by the idle timer, it is possible to cause an unintentional 
            denial-of-service attack. For example, the default timeout of the MAC address cache in Linux is set to 300 seconds.
            Aggressive MAC randomization from many devices in a short
            time interval (e.g., less than 300 seconds) may cause the Layer 2 switch to exhaust its resources, holding in memory
            traffic for a device whose entry can no longer be found. For the RCM device, these 
            effects translate into session discontinuity and disrupt the active sessions. The discontinuity impact
            may vary. Real-time applications such as video conference may experience
            short interruption while non-real-time applications such as video streaming may experience minimal or no impact.
            The device should carefully balance when to change the MAC address after analyzing the nature of the running applications and its
            privacy policy.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-3">In wireless contexts, IEEE 802.1X authenticators <xref target="IEEE_802.1X" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.1X"/> rely on the device and 
            user identity validation provided by a AAA server to change the interface from a blocking state to 
            a forwarding state. The MAC address is used to verify that the device is in the authorized list 
            and to retrieve the associated key used to decrypt the
            device traffic. A change in MAC address causes the port to be closed to the device data traffic
            until the AAA server confirms the validity of the new MAC address. Consequently, MAC address 
            randomization can disrupt the device traffic and strain the AAA server.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-4">Without a unique identification of the device, DHCPv4 servers <xref target="RFC2131" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2131"/> lose track of 
            which IP address is
            validly assigned. Unless the RCM device releases the IP address before changing its MAC address,
            DHCPv4 servers are at risk of scope exhaustion, causing new devices (and RCM devices)
            to fail to obtain a new IP address. Even if the RCM device releases the IP address before
            changing the MAC address, the DHCPv4 server typically holds the released IP address for a certain duration,
            in case the leaving MAC returns. As the DHCPv4 server <xref target="RFC2131" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2131"/> cannot know if 
            the release is due to a temporary
             disconnection or a MAC randomization, the risk of scope address exhaustion exists even in cases
            where the IP address is released.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-5">Network devices with self-assigned IPv6 addresses (e.g., with SLAAC 
            <xref target="RFC4862" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4862"/>) and devices using static IP addresses rely on mechanisms like Optimistic 
            Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) <xref target="RFC4429" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4429"/> and NDP <xref target="RFC4861" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4861"/>  
            for peer devices to establish the association between the target IP address
            and a MAC address, and these peers may cache this association in memory. Changing the MAC address, even
            at the disconnection-reconnection phase, without changing the IP address may disrupt the
            stability of these mappings for these peers if the change occurs within the caching period. Note that 
            this behavior is against standard operation and existing privacy recommendations. Implementations must
            avoid changing the MAC address while maintaining the previously assigned IP address without consulting
            the network.</t>

            policies can be in place to control the
            traffic of some devices (e.g., parental control or blocklist filters). These policies are often 
            based on the device MAC address. MAC address randomization removes the possibility for such control.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-8">In residential settings (environment type A) and in enterprises (environment types D and E),
            device recognition and ranging may be used for IoT-related functionalities (e.g., door unlock, preferred

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-9">In managed residential settings (environment type B) and in enterprises (environment types

            current MAC address. Service improvement support is not possible if the MAC address that

            <t indent="0">RADIUS crypto-agility was first mandated as future work by RFC 6421. The outcome of that work was the publication of RADIUS over TLS (RFC 6614) and RADIUS over DTLS (RFC 7360) as experimental documents. Those transport protocols have been in wide-spread use for many years in a wide range of networks. They have proven their utility as replacements for the previous UDP (RFC 2865) and TCP (RFC 6613) transports. With that knowledge, the continued use of insecure transports for RADIUS has serious and negative implications for privacy and security. The recent publication of the "BlastRADIUS" exploit has also shown that RADIUS security needs to be updated. It is no longer acceptable for RADIUS to rely on MD5 for security. It is no longer acceptable to send device or location information in clear text across the wider Internet. This document therefore deprecates many insecure practices in RADIUS, and mandates support for secure TLS-based transport layers. We also discuss related security issues with RADIUS, and give recommendations for practices which increase both security and privacy.</t>

      WPA2 or WPA3 <xref target="IEEE_802.11i" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.11i"/> encryption schemes are commonly used for onboarding a Wi-Fi device. 
      This allows the mutual identification of the client device or the user of the device and an 
      authentication authority. The authentication exchange does not occur in clear text, and the user or device 
      identity can be concealed from unauthorized observers. However, in most cases, the authentication authority is 
      under the control of the same entity as the network access provider. This may lead to exposing the user 
      or device identity to the network owner.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-2">This scheme is well-adapted to an enterprise environment, where a level of trust is established between the user 
      and the enterprise network operator. In this scheme, MAC address randomization can occur through brief disconnections and 
      reconnections (under the rules of <xref target="IEEE_802.11bh" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.11bh"/>). Authentication may then need to reoccur, with an associated 
      cost of service 
      disruption, an additional load on the enterprise infrastructure, and an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of a 
      continuous MAC address to external observers. The adoption of this scheme is limited outside of the enterprise 
      environment by the requirement to install an authentication profile on the end device, which would be recognized and accepted 
      by a local authentication authority and its authentication server. Such a server is uncommon in a home environment, and the 
      procedure to install a profile is cumbersome for most untrained users.
      The likelihood that a user or device profile would match a profile recognized by 
      a public Wi-Fi authentication authority is also fairly limited. This may restrict the adoption of this scheme for public 
      Wi-Fi as well. Similar limitations are found in the hospitality environment. The hospitality environment refers to space provided 
      by the hospitality industry, which includes but is not limited to hotels, stadiums, restaurants, concert halls, and hospitals.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-1"> In order to alleviate some of the limitations listed above, the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) OpenRoaming 
      standard introduces an intermediate trusted relay between local venues (places where some public Wi-Fi is available)
      and sources of identity  
      <xref target="I-D.tomas-openroaming" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="WBA-OPENROAMING"/>. The federation structure extends the type of authorities that can be 
      used as identity sources (compared to the typical enterprise-based IEEE 802.1X scheme for Wi-Fi <xref target="IEEE_802.1X" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.1X"/>)
      and facilitates the 
      establishment of trust between local networks and an identity provider. Such a procedure increases the likelihood 
      that one or more identity profiles for the user or the device will be recognized by a local network. At the same time, 
      authentication does not occur to the local network. This may offer the possibility for the user or the device to keep 
      their identity obfuscated from the local network operator, unless that operator specifically expresses the requirement to 
      disclose such identity (in which case the user has the option to accept or decline the connection and associated identity exposure).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-2">The OpenRoaming scheme seems well-adapted to public Wi-Fi and hospitality environments. It defines a framework to protect 
      the identity from unauthorized entities while permitting mutual authentication between the device or the user 
      and a trusted identity provider. Just like the standard IEEE 802.1X scheme for Wi-Fi <xref target="IEEE_802.1X" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.1X"/>, 
      authentication allows for the establishment of WPA2 or WPA3 keys <xref target="IEEE_802.11i" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE_802.11i"/> that can then 
      be used to encrypt the communication between the device and the access point. The encryption adds extra protection
      to prevent the network traffic from being eavesdropped.</t>

      an additional load on the venue and identity provider infrastructure, and an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of a 
      continuous MAC address to external observers. Limitations of this scheme include the requirement to first install one or more profiles 
      on the client device. This scheme also requires the local network to support RADSEC <xref target="RFC6614" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6614"/>
      and the relay function, which may not be common in small hotspot networks and home environments.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-4">It is worth noting that, as part of collaborations between the IETF MADINAS Working Group and WBA around OpenRoaming, some RADIUS privacy

      With these schemes, the device changes its MAC address, when not associated, after having used a given MAC address for a

         is also not intended to protect from the exposure of other identifiers to the venue network (e.g., DHCP option 012 [host name] visible to the 
         network between the AP and the DHCPv4 server). </t>
