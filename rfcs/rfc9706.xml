      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">As Internet audience sizes for high-interest live events reach
    unprecedented levels and bitrates climb to support formats and applications such as 4K, 8K, and  Augmented Reality (AR), live streaming can place a unique type of stress upon network
    resources.  TreeDN is a tree-based Content Delivery Network (CDN) architecture designed to address
    the distinctive scaling challenges of live streaming to mass audiences.
    TreeDN enables operators to offer Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) at a
    fraction of the cost of traditional, unicast-based CDNs -- in some cases, at no
    additional cost to the infrastructure.  In addition to efficiently
    utilizing network resources to deliver existing multi-destination traffic,
    this architecture also enables new types of content and use cases that
    previously were not possible or economically viable using traditional CDN
    approaches.  Finally, TreeDN is a decentralized architecture and a
    democratizing technology that makes content distribution
    more accessible to more people by dramatically reducing the costs of
    replication.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-problem-statement">Problem Statement</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">Live streaming to mass audiences can impose unique demands on network
      resources.  For example, live sporting events that broadcast over the
      Internet to end users have a much lower tolerance for long playout
      buffers than typical on-demand video streaming.  Viewers of live
      sporting events have long been conditioned by broadcast television to
      expect to see the content in real time, with only very short buffers for
      broadcast delays to prevent profanity and other objectionable content
      from making on the air (this is known as the "seven-second delay" <xref target="BROADCAST-DELAY" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BROADCAST-DELAY"/>).  With micro-betting, even this 5 to 10 second
      delay can be too long. By comparison, when watching on-demand movies, an
      extra one- or two-minute playout buffer tends to be perfectly acceptable
      for viewers.  If playout buffers for live sports are that long, viewers
      run the risk of being alerted to a game-winning score from text
      messages from friends or cheers from the bar across the street minutes
      before they view it themselves.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">Another unique characteristic of live streaming is the join rate.  While
      on-demand video streaming can consume massive amounts of network
      resources, the viewing rates tend to be smooth and predictable.  Service
      Providers (SPs) observe gradual levels of traffic increases over the evening
      hours corresponding to prime-time viewing habits.  By comparison,
      viewing rates of live video streams can more closely resemble a step
      function with much less predictability as mass audiences of viewers tune
      in to watch the game at the same time.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">Previous efforts for more efficient network replication of
      multi-destination traffic have experienced mixed success in terms of
      adoption.  IP multicast is widely deployed on financial networks, video
      distribution networks, L3VPN networks, and certain enterprises.  However, most
      of these deployments are restricted to "walled-garden" networks.
      Multicast over the global Internet has failed to gain traction, as only
      a very small portion of the Internet is multicast enabled at this
      time.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">TreeDN is a tree-based CDN architecture that is the result of the
      evolution of network-based replication mechanisms and is based on lessons
      learned from what has and has not worked well in the past.  TreeDN
      addresses the fundamental issues of what has hindered multicast from
      adoption on the global Internet and enables SPs the
      opportunity to deliver new Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) offerings to
      content providers, while more efficiently utilizing network resources by
      eliminating duplicated traffic. Thus, this improves the experience of
      end users.  TreeDN accomplishes this with the combination of a
      simplified model of native multicast along with network overlays to
      reach receivers on unicast-only parts of the Internet.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-5">By more efficiently supporting multi-destination traffic, TreeDN is
      an architecture that can enable new types of content (such as AR live streaming to mass audiences) that previously weren't
      possible or economically viable on the Internet due to the
      inefficiencies of unicast.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">While the primary use case mentioned throughout this document is live
      streaming of multimedia content (e.g., audio, video, AR, and real-time telemetry
      data), the TreeDN architecture can provide efficient delivery for any
      content that needs to be replicated and delivered to multiple
      destinations.  For example, large software file updates (e.g., OS
      upgrades) that need to be delivered to many end users in a very short
      window of time can cause significant strain on network resources.  Using
      TreeDN, this use case can be handled much more efficiently by the
      network.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-1">One overlay technology that TreeDN leverages is Automatic Multicast
        Tunneling (AMT) <xref target="RFC7450" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7450"/>.  With AMT, end hosts on
        unicast-only networks (AMT Gateways) can dynamically build tunnels to
        routers on the multicast-enabled part of the network (AMT Relays) and
        receive multicast streams.  The AMT Gateway is a thin software client
        that typically sits on the receiving end host and initiates the tunnel
        at an AMT Relay. The AMT Relay is a tunnel server that typically sits
        at the border of the multicast network.  AMT allows any end host on
        the Internet to receive multicast content regardless of whether their
        local provider supports multicast (aka, "off-net receivers"), which
        addresses the "All or Nothing" problem.  Links and devices that do not
        support multicast are simply tunneled over -- they no longer present a
        barrier to the overall replication service for end users.  Those
        networks that do deploy and support multicast, as well as the content
        providers that serve up multicast content, are able to enjoy the
        benefits of efficient replication and delivery.  Further, these
        benefits can serve as incentives for operators who do not yet support
        multicast to enable it on their networks, which is a key benefit of incremental
        deployment described in <xref target="RFC9049" sectionFormat="of" section="4.3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9049#section-4.3" derivedContent="RFC9049"/>.  Once the cost of carrying duplicated unicast tunnels
        is perceived by those operators to exceed the cost of deploying
        multicast, they are more likely to enable multicast on
	their networks. Thus, TreeDN effectively supports incremental deployment
	in a way that was
	not previously possible with traditional (non-overlay)
        multicast networking.  Finally, AMT also addresses the "Chicken and
        Egg" problem, as all end hosts on the global Internet that have access
        to an AMT Relay are capable of becoming audience members.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-2">To support receiving on both native and non-native networks,
        receiving hosts can first attempt to join the traffic natively, and if
        no multicast traffic is received, they can fall back to AMT.  This fallback
        mechanism can be handled by the application layer.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-3">In addition to AMT, other overlay technologies like the Locator/ID
        Separation Protocol (LISP) <xref target="RFC9300" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9300"/> can be utilized to

        of TreeDN.  The primary requirement of the native on-net component is to support
        Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) <xref target="RFC4607" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4607"/>.  PIM-SSM,
        which is merely a subset of PIM-SM, is the multicast routing protocol
        typically used in SSM.  However, any multicast routing protocol
        capable of supporting SSM can be used in the TreeDN native on-net component, such
        as mLDP, Global Table Multicast (GTM) <xref target="RFC7716" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7716"/>,
        BGP-based Multicast <xref target="I-D.ietf-bess-bgp-multicast" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BGP-MULTICAST"/>, or
        even BGP Multicast VPN (BGP-MVPN) <xref target="RFC6513" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6513"/> for those operators
	who carry
        the global routing table in a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table.
	Likewise, any data plane
        technology that supports SSM, including Bit Index Explicit Replication
        (BIER) <xref target="RFC8279" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8279"/> and Segment Routing (SR) Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) <xref target="RFC9524" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9524"/>,
        can be used.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2-2">The key benefit of SSM as the native on-net component of TreeDN is
        that it radically simplifies the control plane needed to support
        replication in the network.  This simplification comes by moving
        source discovery from the network layer to some sort of out-of-band
        mechanism, usually in the application layer. In SSM, the receiver
        uses the Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) <xref target="RFC3376" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3376"/> for IPv4 or the Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2
        (MLDv2) protocol <xref target="RFC3810" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3810"/> for IPv6 to specify both the source
        and group address of the multicast stream.  This allows the last-hop
        router to immediately join the multicast stream along the
        shortest-path tree (SPT) without the need for shared trees.  This
        benefit addresses the "It's Too Complex" problem.  By eliminating the
        need for network-based source discovery, most of the complexity of
        multicast is then eliminated, which reduces the cost of deploying and
        operating a multicast network.  Further rationale for this SSM-only
        approach can be found in Any-Source Multicast (ASM) Deprecation <xref target="RFC8815" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8815"/>.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-1">Content providers have traditionally used CDNs to distribute content
      that needs to be delivered to large audiences, essentially outsourcing
      the task of replication to CDN providers.  Most CDNs utilize unicast
      delivery, as multicast is not an option due to its lack of general
      availability on the global Internet.  TreeDN is a CDN architecture that
      leverages tree-based replication to more efficiently utilize network
      resources to deliver simultaneous multi-destination traffic.  By
      leveraging overlay networking to address the "All or Nothing" and
      "Chicken and Egg" problems, and leveraging SSM to address the "It's Too Complex"
      problem, TreeDN avoids the practical issues that previously prevented
      multicast from being a viable option for CDN providers.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-2">TreeDN has several advantages over traditional unicast-based CDN
      approaches.  First, the TreeDN functionality can be delivered entirely
      by the existing network infrastructure.  Specifically, for operators
      with routers that support AMT natively, multicast traffic can be
      delivered directly to end users without the need for specialized CDN
      devices, which typically are servers that need to be racked, powered,
      cooled, and connected to ports on routers that otherwise could have been
      consumed by paying customers.  In this way, SPs can offer new RaaS
      functionality to content providers at potentially zero additional cost
      in new equipment.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-3">Additionally, TreeDN is an open architecture that leverages mature,
      IETF-specified, and widely implemented network protocols.  TreeDN also
      requires far less coordination between the content provider and the CDN
      operator.  That is, there are no storage requirements for the data, nor
      group-key management issues, since a TreeDN provider merely forwards
      packets.  A TreeDN provider simply needs to have enough accounting data
      (e.g., traffic data, number of AMT tunnels, etc.) to properly bill
      customers for the service.  By contrast, traditional unicast-based CDNs
      often incorporate proprietary, non-interoperable technologies and
      require significant coordination between the content provider and the
      CDN to handle such things as file storage, data protection, and
      key management.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-4">TreeDN introduces a deployment model that requires new considerations
      for transport-layer mechanisms that are frequently relied upon by
      traditional unicast-based CDNs.  A discussion on these considerations

      effectively reducing the marginal cost of reaching each
      additional audience member to zero, from the perspective of the source, TreeDN
      democratizes content sourcing on the Internet.</t>

        telemetry data from receivers detailing end-user experience,
        distribution of decryption keys, switching to higher or lower bandwidth
        streams, etc.) are not well suited to SSM delivery.  As such, separate
        unicast streams between receivers and content providers may be used
        for this type of "out-of-band" function while SSM is used to deliver
        the actual content of interest.  These "out-of-band" unicast streams
        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the same congestion control and authentication mechanisms

      and troubleshoot a PIM-SSM domain and an AMT deployment can be used to
      manage a TreeDN deployment.  Protocol error handling for PIM-SSM can be
      found in <xref target="RFC4607" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4607"/> and in <xref target="RFC7761" sectionFormat="of" section="4.8" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7761#section-4.8" derivedContent="RFC7761"/>; for AMT, it can be found in <xref target="RFC7450" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7450"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-2">One potential operational benefit of a multicast-based approach like
      TreeDN over a traditional, unicast-based CDN is the visibility that
      multicast state provides in the routing infrastructure.  That is,
      multicast routers maintain a forwarding cache of multicast flows that
      usually includes the source address, group address, incoming/outgoing
      interfaces, and forwarding rate.  Generally speaking, such flow state
      information is not typically available in core networks for unicast, so
      additional tools outside the routing infrastructure are usually required
      for monitoring CDN performance and troubleshooting issues like packet
      loss location.  Of course, this benefit comes at a cost of additional
      state being maintained in the routers for multicast.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-3">Additionally, since multicast leverages Reverse Path Forwarding
      (RPF), the source of the content can potentially have a greater
      influence over the path taken through the network from source to native
      receivers/AMT relays.  That is, the BGP peer advertising the
      reachability of the source's subnet can do so in ways where a particular path through the network is preferred for multicast distribution; these methods are
      not as easy to accomplish with traditional, destination-based unicast
      routing.</t>

   version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for the purpose of a group key management.
   The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key
   management architecture, which contains two components: member
   registration and group rekeying.  Both components are required for a
   GCKS (Group Controller/Key Server) to provide authorized Group
   Members (GMs) with IPsec group security associations.  The group
   members then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec
   packets.

              <t indent="0">This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative- ACKnowledgment (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol. This protocol can provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services. NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal a priori coordination among senders and receivers. A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers. The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher-level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways. The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based (forward error correction) repair and other IETF Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks in its design. This document obsoletes RFC 3940.

Some of these procedures use BGP to distribute VPN-specific multicast routing information across a backbone network. With a small number of relatively minor modifications, the same BGP procedures can also be used to distribute multicast routing information that is not specific to any VPN. Multicast that is outside the context of a VPN is known as "Global Table Multicast", or sometimes simply as "Internet multicast".

This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets. It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a "multicast domain". However, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state. This architecture is known as "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER). When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent. The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header. The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER header. The procedures for forwarding a packet based on its BIER header are specified in this document. Elimination of the per-flow state and the explicit tree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification.</t>
