unforeseen application for conventional routing protocols. The high
rate of intentional topological change and the extreme scale
are unprecedented in terrestrial networking. Links between satellites
can utilize free-space optics technology that allows liberal
connectivity. Still, there are limitations due to the range of the
links and conjunction with the sun, resulting in links that are far
less reliable than network designers are used to. In addition, links
can change their endpoints dynamically, resulting in structural
changes to the topology.</t>

for such networks utilizing current standards-based routing technology

operators, but without specific details, this document can only

have their orbital periods synchronized to planetary rotation, so they
are effectively stationary over a single point.  Other satellites have orbits
that cause them to travel across regions of the planet either gradually or quite
rapidly. Respectively, these are typically known as the Geostationary Earth Orbit
(GEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), or Low Earth Orbit (LEO), depending on the
altitude.  This discussion is not Earth-specific; as we get to other planets, we
can test this approach's generality.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-2">Satellites may have data interconnections with one another through
Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs). Due to differences in orbits, ISLs may be
connected temporarily with periods of potential connectivity computed through
orbital dynamics. Multiple satellites may be in the same orbit but separated in
space with a roughly constant separation. Satellites in the same orbit may have
ISLs that have a higher duty cycle than ISLs between different orbits, but they are
still not guaranteed to be always connected.</t>

region. User stations are Earth stations with a limited capacity that
communicate with only a single satellite at a time.  Other Earth
stations that may have richer connectivity and higher bandwidth are
commonly called "gateways" and provide connectivity between the
satellite network and conventional wired networks. Gateways serve user
stations in their geographic proximity and are replicated globally as
necessary to provide coverage and to meet service density goals. User
stations are associated with a single local gateway.  Traffic from one
Earth station to another may need to traverse a path across multiple
satellites via ISLs.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4.1-1">We assume that the primary use of the satellite network is to provide
access from a wide range of geographic locations. We also assume that
providing high-bandwidth bulk transit between peer networks is not a
goal. It has been noted that satellite networks can provide lower
latencies than terrestrial fiber networks in <xref target="Handley" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Handley"/>. This proposal
does not preclude such applications but does not articulate the
mechanisms necessary for user stations to perform the appropriate
traffic engineering computations. Low-latency, multicast, and anycast
applications are not discussed further in this document.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4.1-2">As with most access networks, we assume that there will be
bidirectional traffic between the user station and the gateway but
that the bulk of the traffic will be from the gateway to the user
station. We expect the uplink from the gateway to the satellite
network to be the bandwidth bottleneck and that gateways will need to
be replicated to scale the uplink bandwidth, as the satellite capacity reachable
from a gateway will be limited.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4.1-3">We assume that it is not essential to provide optimal routing for
traffic from user station to user station. If this traffic is sent
to a gateway first and then back into the satellite network, it
might be acceptable to some operators as long as the traffic volume
remains very low. This type of routing is not discussed further in this document.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4.1-4">We assume that traffic for a user station should enter the satellite
network through a gateway that is in some close geographic proximity
to the user station. This is to reduce the number of ISLs used by the
path to the user station. Similarly, we assume that user station
traffic should exit the satellite network through the gateway that is
in the closest geographic proximity to the user
station. Jurisdictional requirements for landing traffic in certain
regions may alter these assumptions, but such situations are outside
the scope of this document.</t>

its direct satellite and its local gateway via protocols outside the scope of

demand. If this assumption does not hold, no routing architecture

      <name slugifiedName="name-forwarding-plane">Forwarding Plane</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">The end goal of a network is to deliver traffic. In a satellite
      network where the topology is in a continual state of flux and the user
      stations frequently change their association with the satellites, having
      a highly flexible and adaptive forwarding plane is essential. Toward
      this end, we propose using MPLS as the fundamental forwarding plane
      architecture <xref target="RFC3031" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3031"/>. Specifically, we propose using an
      approach based on Segment Routing (SR) <xref target="RFC8402" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8402"/> with an
      MPLS data plane <xref target="RFC8660" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8660"/>, where each satellite is
      assigned a node Segment Identifier (SID). This allows the architecture
      to support both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently.  A path through the network
      can then be expressed as a label stack of node SIDs.  IP forwarding is
      not used within the internals of the satellite network, although each
      satellite may be assigned an IP address for management
      purposes. Existing techniques may be used to limit the size of the SR
      label stack so that it only contains the significant waypoints along the
      path <xref target="Giorgetti" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Giorgetti"/>. The label stack operates as a loose
      source route through the network. If there is an unexpected topology
      change in the network, the IGP will compute a new path to the next
      waypoint, allowing packet delivery despite ISL failures. While the IGP
      is converging, there may be micro-loops in the topology. These can be
      avoided by using Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA) paths
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SR-TI-LFA"/>; otherwise,
      traffic will loop until discarded based on its TTL.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">We assume that there is a link-layer mechanism for a user station to
      associate with a satellite. User stations will have an IP address
      assigned from a prefix managed by its local gateway. The mechanisms for
      this assignment and its communication to the end station are not
      discussed herein but might be similar to DHCP <xref target="RFC2131" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2131"/>. User station IP addresses change infrequently and do
      not reflect their association with their first-hop satellite. Gateways
      and their supporting terrestrial networks advertise prefixes covering
      all its local user stations throughout the global Internet.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">User stations may be assigned a node SID, in which case MPLS
forwarding can be used for all hops to the user
station. Alternatively, if the user station does not have a node SID,
then the last hop from the satellite to the end station can be
performed based on the destination IP address of the packet. This does
not require a full longest-prefix-match lookup, as the IP address is
merely a unique identifier at this point.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">Similarly, gateways may be assigned a node SID. A possible
optimization is that a single SID value could be assigned as a global
constant to always direct traffic to the topologically closest
gateway.  If traffic engineering is required for traffic that is
flowing to a gateway, a specific path may be encoded in a label stack
that is attached to the packet by the user station or by the first-hop
satellite.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-5">Gateways can also perform traffic engineering using different paths
and label stacks for separate traffic flows. Routing a single traffic
flow across multiple paths has proven to cause performance issues with
transport protocols, so that approach is not recommended. Traffic engineering is
discussed further in <xref target="trafficEngineering" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">As discussed in <xref target="scalability" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2.3"/>, IS-IS is architecturally the best fit for
satellite networks but does require some novel approaches to achieve the
scalability goals for a satellite network.  In particular, we propose that all
nodes in the network be L1L2 so that local routing is done based on L1
information and then global routing is done based on L2 information.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">An interesting property of IS-IS is that it does not require
interface addresses. This feature is commonly known as "unnumbered
interfaces". This is particularly helpful in satellite topologies
because it implies that ISLs may be used flexibly. Sometimes an
interface might be used as an L1 link to another satellite, and a few
orbits later, it might be used as an L1L2 link to a completely
different satellite without any reconfiguration or renumbering.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-3">Scalability for IS-IS can be achieved through a proposal
known as "Area Proxy" <xref target="RFC9666" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9666"/>. With this
proposal, all nodes in an L1 area combine their information
into a single L2 Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP). This implies
that the size of the L1 Link State Database (LSDB) scales as the
number of nodes in the L1 area and the size of the L2 LSDB scales with
the number of L1 areas.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">With Area Proxy, topological changes within an L1 area will not be visible to
other areas, so the overhead of link-state changes will be greatly reduced.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-5">The Area Proxy proposal also includes the concept of an Area SID. This
is useful because it allows traffic engineering to construct a path
that traverses areas with a minimal number of label stack entries.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-6">For example, suppose that a network has 1,000 L1 areas, each with
1,000 satellites. This would mean that the network supports
1,000,000 satellites but only requires 1,000 entries in its L1 LSDB
and 1,000 entries in its L2 LSDB, which are easily achievable
numbers today. The resulting MPLS label table would contain 1,000 node SIDs
from the L1 (and L2) LSDB and 1,000 area SIDs from the L2 LSDB.  If each
satellite advertises an IP address for management purposes, then the
IP routing table would have 1,000 entries for the L1 management
addresses and 1,000 area proxy addresses from L2.</t>

in the satellite topology. In particular, there are no IP
routes for user stations or the remainder of the Internet.</t>

reliability and persistence than inter-orbit ISLs. However, even
intra-orbit ISLs are not sufficiently reliable to avoid partition

orbits as an IS-IS L1 area, called a "stripe". We assume that
for any given reliability requirement, there is a small number of
orbits that can be used to form a stripe that satisfies the
reliability requirement.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-5-3">Stripes are connected to other adjacent stripes using the same ISL

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-7">The local gateway forwards this into the satellite network. The first-hop
satellite now forwards based on the area label (A) at the top of the stack. All
area labels are propagated as part of the L2 topology. This forwarding continues
until the packet reaches a satellite adjacent to the destination
area. That satellite pops label A, removing that label and forwarding the packet
into the destination area.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-8">The packet is now forwarded based on the remaining label U, which was
propagated as part of the L1 topology. The last satellite forwards the
packet based on the destination address (D) and forwards the packet to
the user station.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-9">The return case is similar. The label stack, in this case, consists of a label
for the local gateway's stripe/area (A') and the label for the local gateway (L),
resulting in the stack (A', L). The forwarding mechanisms are similar to the
previous case.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-10">Very frequently, access networks congest due to over-subscription and
the economics of access. Network operators can use traffic engineering
to ensure that they get higher efficiency out of their
networks by utilizing all available paths and capacity near any
congestion points. In this particular case, the gateway will have
information about all of the traffic it is generating and can use
all of the possible paths through the network in its topological
neighborhood.  Since we're already using SR, this is easily done
by adding more explicit SIDs to the label stack. These can be
additional area SIDs, node SIDs, or adjacency SIDs. Path computation
can be performed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs) <xref target="RFC4655" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4655"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-11">Each gateway or its PCE will need topological information from the
areas it will route through. It can do this by participating in the
IGP directly, via a tunnel, or through another delivery mechanism such
as BGP-LS <xref target="RFC9552" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9552"/>.  User stations do not participate in the IGP.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-12">Traffic engineering for packets flowing into a gateway can also be
provided by an explicit SR path. This can help ensure that ISLs near
the gateway do not congest with traffic for the gateway.  These paths
can be computed by the gateway or PCE and then distributed to the
first-hop satellite or user station, which would apply them to
traffic. The delivery mechanism is outside the scope of this
document.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-scheduling">Scheduling</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-1">The most significant difference between terrestrial and satellite
networks from a routing perspective is that some of the topological
changes that will happen to the network can be anticipated and
computed. Both link and node changes will affect the topology, and the
network should react smoothly and predictably.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-2">The management plane is responsible for providing information about
scheduled topological changes. The exact details of how the
information is disseminated are outside the scope of this document
but could be shown through a YANG model
<xref target="I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="YANG-SCHEDULE"/>.

Scheduling information needs to be
accessible to all of the nodes that will make routing decisions based
on the topological changes in the schedule (i.e., data about an L1
topological change will need to be circulated to all nodes in the L1
area and information about L2 changes will need to propagate to all
L2 nodes) and to the gateways and PCEs that carry the related
topological information.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-3">There is very little that the network should do in response to a
topological addition. A link coming up or a node joining the topology
should not have any functional change until the change is proven to be
fully operational based on the usual IS-IS liveness mechanisms. Nodes
may pre-compute their routing table changes but should not install
them before all relevant adjacencies are received. The benefits of
this pre-computation appear to be very small. Gateways and PCEs may
also choose to pre-compute paths based on these changes but should
not install paths using the new parts of the topology until they are
confirmed to be operational. If some path pre-installation is
performed, gateways and PCEs must be prepared for the situation where
the topology fails to become operational and may need to take
alternate steps instead, such as reverting any related pre-installed
paths.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-4">The network may choose not to pre-install or
pre-compute routes in reaction to topological additions, at a small
cost of some operational efficiency.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-5">Topological deletions are an entirely different matter. If a link or
node is to be removed from the topology, the network should act
before the anticipated change to route traffic around the expected
topological loss. Specifically, at some point before the topology
change, the affected links should be set to a high metric to direct
traffic to alternate paths. This is a common operational procedure in
existing networks when links are taken out of service, such as when
proactive maintenance needs to be performed. This type of change does
require some time to propagate through the network, so the metric
change should be initiated far enough in advance that the network
converges before the actual topological change. Gateways and PCEs
should also update paths around the topology change and install these
changes before the topology change occurs. The time necessary for
both IGP and path changes will vary depending on the exact network and
configuration.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-6">Strictly speaking, changing to a high metric should not be necessary. It should
be possible for each router to exclude the link and recompute
paths. However, it seems safer to change the metric and use the IGP methods
for indicating a topology change, as this can help avoid issues with incomplete
information dissemination and synchronization.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-1">This architecture needs to be validated by satellite operators, both
via simulation and operational deployment. Meaningful simulation
hinges on the exact statistics of ISL connectivity; currently, that
information is not publicly available.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-2">Current available information about ISLs indicates that links are
mechanically steered and will need to track the opposite end of the
link continually. The angles and distances that can be practically
supported are unknown, as are any limitations about the rate of
change.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-3">It is expected that intra-orbit and inter-orbit ISL links will have
very different properties. Intra-orbit links should be much more
stable but still far less stable than terrestrial links.  Inter-orbit
links will be less stable. Links between satellites that are roughly
parallel should be possible but will likely have a limited
duration. Two orbits may be roughly orthogonal, resulting in a limited
potential for connectivity. Finally, in some topologies there may be
parallel orbits where the satellites move in opposite directions,
giving a relative speed between satellites around 34,000 mph
(55,000 kph).  Links in this situation may not be possible or may be so
short-lived that they are impractical.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-4">The key question to address is whether the parameters of a given
network can yield a stripe assignment that produces stable, connected
areas that work within the scaling bounds of the IGP. If links are
very stable, a stripe could be just a few parallel orbits, with
only a few hundred satellites. However, if links are unstable,
a stripe might have to encompass dozens of orbits and thousands
of satellites, which might be beyond the scaling limitations of a
given IGP's implementation.</t>

This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes the modifications to OSPF to support version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). The fundamental mechanisms of OSPF (flooding, Designated Router (DR) election, area support, Short Path First (SPF) calculations, etc.) remain unchanged. However, some changes have been necessary, either due to changes in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6, or simply to handle the increased address size of IPv6. These modifications will necessitate incrementing the protocol version from version 2 to version 3. OSPF for IPv6 is also referred to as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3).</t>
              <t indent="0">Changes between OSPF for IPv4, OSPF Version 2, and OSPF for IPv6 as described herein include the following. Addressing semantics have been removed from OSPF packets and the basic Link State Advertisements (LSAs). New LSAs have been created to carry IPv6 addresses and prefixes. OSPF now runs on a per-link basis rather than on a per-IP-subnet basis. Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized. Authentication has been removed from the OSPF protocol and instead relies on IPv6's Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).</t>
              <t indent="0">Even with larger IPv6 addresses, most packets in OSPF for IPv6 are almost as compact as those in OSPF for IPv4. Most fields and packet- size limitations present in OSPF for IPv4 have been relaxed. In addition, option handling has been made more flexible.</t>
              <t indent="0">All of OSPF for IPv4's optional capabilities, including demand circuit support and Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSAs), are also supported in OSPF for IPv6. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">In many environments, a component external to a network is called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and the current state of the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information. This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE information can be collected from networks and shared with external components using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism applies to physical and virtual (e.g., tunnel) IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control.</t>
              <t indent="0">Applications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).</t>

              <t indent="0">   This document presents Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate Fast
   Reroute (TI-LFA), aimed at providing protection of node and adjacency
   segments within the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This Fast
   Reroute (FRR) behavior builds on proven IP Fast Reroute concepts
   being LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs with directed
   forwarding (DLFA).  It extends these concepts to provide guaranteed
   coverage in any two-connected networks using a link-state IGP.  An
   important aspect of TI-LFA is the FRR path selection approach
   establishing protection over the expected post-convergence paths from
   the point of local repair, reducing the operational need to control
   the tie-breaks among various FRR options.
