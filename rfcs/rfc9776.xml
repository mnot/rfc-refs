      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">The Internet Group Management
   Protocol (IGMP) is the protocol used by IPv4 systems to
   report their IP multicast group memberships to neighboring multicast
   routers.  Version 3 of IGMP (IGMPv3) adds support for source filtering, that
   is, the ability for a system to report interest in receiving packets
   only from specific source addresses, or from all but specific
   source addresses, sent to a particular multicast address.  That
   information may be used by multicast routing protocols to avoid
   delivering multicast packets from specific sources to networks where
   there are no interested receivers.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">This document specifies IGMPv3.  It is a revised
   version of RFC 3376 that includes
   clarifications and fixes for errata, and it is backward compatible
   with RFC 3376.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used by IPv4 systems
   (hosts and routers) to report their IP multicast group memberships to
   any neighboring multicast routers.  Note that an IP multicast router
   may itself be a member of one or more multicast groups, in which case
   it performs both the multicast router part of the protocol (to
   collect the membership information needed by its multicast routing
   protocol) and the group member part of the protocol (to inform
   itself and other, neighboring multicast routers of its memberships).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">IGMP is also used for other IP multicast management functions, using

   version to become an Internet Standard.  Version 2, specified in
   <xref target="RFC2236" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2236"/>, added support for low leave latency, that is, a
   reduction in the time it takes for a multicast router to learn that
   there are no longer any members of a particular group present on an
   attached network.  Version 3 adds support for source filtering,
   that is, the ability for a system to report interest in receiving
   packets only from specific source addresses, as required to support
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) <xref target="RFC3569" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3569"/>, or from all but specific source
   addresses, sent to a particular multicast address.  Version 3 is

   the capabilities of IGMPv3, a system's IP service interface must
   support the following operation:</t>

     a special "unspecified" value to be passed as the interface
     parameter, in which case the request would apply to the "primary"
     or "default" interface of the system (perhaps established by system

   multicast packets -- and multicast routers.  This section describes
   the part of IGMPv3 that applies to all group members.  (Note that a
   multicast router that is also a group member performs both parts of
   IGMPv3, receiving and responding to its own IGMP message
   transmissions as well as those of its neighbors.  The multicast
	   router part of IGMPv3 is described in <xref target="mcast_rtrs" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>.)</t>

   IGMP, systems maintain a MulticastRouterVersion variable for each
   interface on which multicast reception is supported.  This section
   describes the behavior of group member systems on interfaces for
   which MulticastRouterVersion = 3.  The algorithm for determining
   MulticastRouterVersion, and the behavior for versions other than 3,

   sources are of interest to neighboring systems, for packets sent to
   any particular multicast address.  The information gathered by IGMP

   membership information from an attached network.  These Queries are
   used to build and refresh the group membership state of systems on

   receiving or not receiving traffic from particular sources.  As the
   desired reception state of a system changes, it reports these changes
   using Filter-Mode-Change Records or Source-List-Change Records.
   These records indicate an explicit state change in a group at a
   system in either the Group Record's source-list or its filter-mode.
   When a group membership is terminated at a system or traffic from a

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-3">To enable all systems on a network to respond to changes in group
	membership, multicast routers send specific queries. A Group Specific
   Query is sent to verify there are no systems that desire

   reception state for a particular group.  Group Specific Queries are

   This query is sent by a multicast router to learn if any systems

Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast in which a receiver is required to specify both the network-layer address of the source and the multicast destination address in order to receive the multicast transmission. This document defines the notion of an "SSM-aware" router and host, and clarifies and (in some cases) modifies the behavior of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 on SSM-aware routers and hosts to accommodate source-specific multicast.

              <t indent="0">The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMPv3) for IPv4 and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2) for IPv6 add the capability for applications to express source filters on multicast group memberships, which allows receiver applications to determine the set of senders (sources) from which to accept multicast traffic. This capability also simplifies support of one-to-many type multicast applications. This document specifies new socket options and functions to manage source filters for IP Multicast group memberships. It also defines the socket structures to provide input and output arguments to these new application program interfaces (APIs). These extensions are designed to provide access to the source filtering features, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing multicast applications.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-2">Routers need to distinguish Membership Reports that were sent in
   response to Queries from those that were sent as a result of a change
   in interface state.  Membership reports that are sent in response to
   Membership Queries are used mainly to refresh the existing state at
   the router; they typically do not cause transitions in state at the
   router.  Membership Reports that are sent in response to changes in
   interface state require the router to take some action in response to
	   the received report (see <xref target="rcv_rpts" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.4"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-3">The inability to distinguish between the two types of reports would
   force a router to treat all Membership Reports as potential changes
   in state, and it could result in increased processing at the router as

   from all sources unless that source exists in the exclusion source-list.
   If all hosts in EXCLUDE mode cease to exist, it would be
   desirable for the router to switch back to INCLUDE mode seamlessly

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3-2">One of the ways to accomplish this is for routers to keep track of
   all sources desired by hosts that are in INCLUDE mode even though the

   EXCLUDE mode, it implies that there are no hosts in EXCLUDE mode on
   the network (otherwise, a Membership Report from that host would have
   refreshed the Group Timer).  The router can then switch to INCLUDE
   mode seamlessly with the list of sources currently being forwarded in
