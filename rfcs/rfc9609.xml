      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Recursive DNS resolvers need a starting point to resolve queries. <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/> describes a common scenario for recursive resolvers: They
begin with an empty cache and some configuration for finding the names and
addresses of the DNS root servers. <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/> describes that
configuration as a list of servers that will give authoritative answers to queries
about the root. This has become a common implementation choice for recursive
resolvers and is the topic of this document. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">This document describes the steps needed for this common implementation
choice. Note that this is not the only way to start a recursive name server with
an empty cache, but it is the only one described in <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/>.
Some implementers have chosen other directions, some of which work well and
others of which fail (sometimes disastrously) under different conditions.
For example, an implementation that only gets the addresses of the root name
servers from configuration, not from the DNS as described in this document,
will have stale data that could cause slower resolution.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">Priming is the act of finding the list of root
servers from a configuration that lists some or all of the purported IP
addresses of some or all of those root servers.
In priming, a recursive resolver starts with no cached information about the root servers,
and it finishes with a full list of their names and addresses in its cache.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">Priming is described in Sections <xref target="RFC1034" section="5.3.2" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034#section-5.3.2" derivedContent="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1034" section="5.3.3" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034#section-5.3.3" derivedContent="RFC1034"/> of <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/>. (It is called "SBELT", a "safety belt" structure, in that document.)
The scenario used in that description, that of a recursive server that is also
authoritative, is no longer as common.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">The configured list of IP addresses for the root servers usually comes from the
vendor or distributor of the recursive server software.
Although this list is generally accurate and complete at the time of distribution,
it may become outdated over time.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4">The domain names for the root servers are called the
"root server identifiers".
Although this list has remained stable since 1997, the associated IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for these root server identifiers occasionally change.
Research indicates that, following such changes, certain resolvers fail to update to the new addresses; for further details, refer to <xref target="OLD-J" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="OLD-J"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-5">Therefore, it is important that resolvers are able to cope with change,
even without relying upon configuration updates to be applied by their operator.
Root server identifier and address changes are the main reasons that resolvers
need to use priming to get a full and accurate list of root servers,
instead of just using a statically configured list.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-6">
See <xref target="RSSAC023v2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RSSAC023v2"/> for a history of the root server system.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-7">Although this document is targeted at the global DNS, it could apply to a private
DNS as well. These terms are defined in <xref target="RFC9499" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9499"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-8">Some systems serve a copy of the full root zone on the same server as the resolver,
e.g., as described in <xref target="RFC8806" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8806"/>.
In such a setup, the resolver primes its cache using the same methods as those
described in the rest of this document.</t>

The priming information in software may be in any format that gives the software the
addresses associated with at least some of the root server identifiers.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-2">Some software has configuration that also contains the root server identifiers (such as "L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET"),
sometimes as comments and sometimes as data consumed by the software.
For example, the "root hints file" published by IANA at <eref target="https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root" brackets="angle"/>
is derived directly from the root zone and contains all of the addresses
of the root server identifiers found in the root zone.
It is in DNS zone file presentation format and includes the root server identifiers.
Although there is no harm in adding these names, they are not useful in
the priming process.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">A priming query is a DNS query whose response provides root server identifiers and addresses.
It has a QNAME of ".", a QTYPE of NS, and a QCLASS of IN;
it is sent to one of the addresses in the configuration for the recursive resolver.
The priming query can be sent over either UDP or TCP. If the query is sent over UDP,
the source port <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be randomly selected (see <xref target="RFC5452" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5452"/>) to hamper on-path attacks.
DNS cookies <xref target="RFC7873" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7873"/> can also be used to hamper on-path attacks.
The Recursion Desired (RD) bit <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be set to 0. The meaning when RD is set

the root zone has expired.
Because the NS records for the root zone are not special, the recursive resolver
expires those NS records according to their TTL values.

pre-fetch the NS RRset before it expires.)</t>

All root servers are also authoritative for the "root-servers.net" zone,

However, because at the time this document is published the "root-servers.net" zone is not signed,
the root name server A and AAAA RRsets cannot be validated.

              <t indent="0">The Domain Name System (DNS) is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs. The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and by operators of DNS systems, has changed in the decades since the DNS was first defined. This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in the DNS in a single document.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document updates RFC 2308 by clarifying the definitions of "forwarder" and "QNAME". It obsoletes RFC 8499 by adding multiple terms and clarifications. Comprehensive lists of changed and new definitions can be found in Appendices A and B.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have difficulty getting responses from the root servers, such as during a network attack. Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to prevent snooping by third parties of requests sent to DNS root servers. In both cases, resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent observation of requests by serving a copy of the full root zone on the same server, such as on a loopback address or in the resolver software. This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that does not cause problems for other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility for the operator.</t>
