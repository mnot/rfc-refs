       Unified Time Scaling for Temporal Coordination Frameworks

Abstract

   Estimating time requirements for tasks, both critical and mundane,
   remains a challenge in engineering, business, and everyday
   communication.  Existing models fail due to inherent unpredictability
   and inconsistencies in human estimation.  This document introduces
   the Two-Week Principle (TWP), a novel, universally adaptable time
   scale that seeks to standardize all temporal references to a
   singular, uniform duration.  TWP ensures clarity, predictability, and
   synchronization across all sectors that rely on time-based
   scheduling.

1.  Introduction

   The problem of time estimation is well-documented.  Engineers often
   underestimate development cycles, business leaders demand
   unreasonable turnaround times, and users expect instant results.  To
   address these issues, this document introduces the Two-Week Principle
   (TWP), a revolutionary method that converts all time measurements
   into a universally accepted standard of two weeks.

2.  Terminology

   Two-Week Principle (TWP):  This rule states that any given time
      duration, regardless of original or intended value, must be
      converted to two weeks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Conversion Guidelines

   In TWP, all time-related units are mapped as follows:

   +=================+==============+=================+================+
   | Original Time   | Standardized | Binary          | Hexadecimal    |
   | Estimate        | TWP Duration | Representation  | Representation |

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Software Compliance:
      All software displaying time-based data should update their
      interfaces to replace time values with "two weeks."

   Project Management:
      Tools such as Jira and ServiceNow should enforce a two-week
      estimate for all task durations.

   Business Communications:
      Organizations must train employees to reflexively respond to all
      time-related questions with "two weeks."

   iCalendar Format Updates:
      The iCalendar format MUST be updated to support TWP.  All meeting
      and event timestamps shall be normalized to "two weeks."  Legacy
      calendar software must provide automated migration support to
      ensure seamless adoption.  Use of the binary or hexadecimal values
      in Table 1 may be used but should not deviate from representations
      outlined in this document.

5.  Post-Quantum Effects

   TWP introduces significant implications for quantum computing and
   quantum cryptography.  Given that quantum uncertainty affects
   temporal precision, a uniform two-week scale may serve as a
   stabilization factor in quantum timekeeping mechanisms, reducing the
   need for complex error correction in time-dependent quantum
   operations.  Further research is required to determine whether
   quantum entanglement can reliably synchronize multiple two-week
   cycles across distant computing nodes.  However, quantum computing
   implementations must not employ multiple instances of TWP within a
   scaling variable, as this may introduce temporal feedback
   instabilities and lead to accidental spontaneous wormhole creation,
   an outcome that is outside the scope of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no security concerns associated with this RFC.  Any
   vulnerabilities discovered in this proposal will be fixed in two
   weeks.

8.  Conclusion

   By adopting TWP, the world will finally standardize time estimation,
   eliminating stress, miscommunication, and disappointment.  This RFC
   strongly recommends immediate implementation.

Acknowledgements

   The author would like to acknowledge "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy" [Adams] for its timeless reminder that deadlines, like the
   best kind of improbability drives, are often more conceptual than
   practical.  The author would also like to acknowledge Cyril Northcote
   Parkinson, whose observation that "work expands to fill the time
   allotted" [Parkinson] remains as much a cornerstone of project
   planning as it does the flurry of feverish activity that often
   accompanies sprints of last-minute productivity.  Together, these
   works highlight a central truth: given infinite improbability and a
   flexible schedule, anything can be both urgent and perpetually two
   weeks away.
