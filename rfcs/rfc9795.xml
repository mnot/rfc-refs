      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This document extends Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), a token for conveying cryptographically signed call information about personal communications, to include rich metadata about a call and caller that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted, and subsequently rendered to the called party. This framework is intended to include and extend caller- and call-specific information beyond human-readable display name, comparable to the "Caller ID" function common on the telephone network. It is also enhanced with an integrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring and transport of this information for different authoritative use cases.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">PASSporT <xref target="RFC8225" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8225"/> is a token format based on JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7519"/> for conveying cryptographically signed information about the parties involved in personal communications; it is used to convey a signed assertion of the identity of the participants in real-time communications established via a protocol like SIP <xref target="RFC8224" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8224"/>. The Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) problem statement <xref target="RFC7340" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7340"/> declared securing the display name of callers outside of STIR's initial scope. This document extends the use of JWT and PASSporT in the overall STIR framework by defining a PASSporT extension and the associated STIR procedures to protect additional caller- and call-related information.  This is information beyond the calling party originating identity (e.g., telephone number or SIP URI) that is intended to be rendered to assist a called party in determining whether to accept or trust incoming communications. This includes information such as the name of the person or entity on one side of a communications session, for example, the traditional "Caller ID" of the telephone network along with related display information that would be rendered to the called party during alerting or potentially used by an automaton to determine whether and how to alert a called party to a call and whom is calling.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Traditional telephone network signaling protocols have long supported delivering a 'calling name' from the originating side, though in practice the terminating side is often left to determine a name from the calling party number by consulting a local address book or an external database. SIP, for example, similarly can carry this information in a display-name in the From header field value (or alternatively the Call-Info header field) from the originating to terminating side. In this document, we utilize the STIR framework to more generally extend the assertion of an extensible set of identity information not limited to but including calling name.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">This document extends PASSporT to provide cryptographic protection for the "display-name" field of SIP requests, or similar name fields in other protocols, as well as further "rich call data" (RCD) about the caller, which includes the contents of the Call-Info header field or other data structures that can be added to the PASSporT. In addition, <xref target="use" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 12"/> describes use cases that enable external third-party authorities to convey rich information associated with a calling number via an "rcd" PASSporT while clearly identifying the third-party as the source of the Rich Call Data information.
Finally, this document describes how to preserve the integrity of the RCD in scenarios where there may be non-authoritative users initiating and signing RCD, therefore limiting a PASSporT and the RCD claims it asserts via certificate-level controls.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-overview-of-the-use-of-the-">Overview of the Use of the Rich Call Data PASSporT Extension</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">This document defines Rich Call Data (RCD), which is a PASSporT extension <xref target="RFC8225" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8225"/> that defines an extensible claim for asserting information about the call beyond the telephone number. This includes more detailed information about the calling party, calling number, or the purpose of the call. There are many use cases that this document describes around the entities responsible for the signing and integrity of this information, whether it is the entity that originates a call, a service provider acting on behalf of a caller, or when third-party services may be authoritative over the RCD on behalf of the caller. In general, PASSporT <xref target="RFC8225" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8225"/> has been defined to be independent of the communications protocol, but its initial usage as detailed in <xref target="RFC8224" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8224"/> is with the SIP protocol <xref target="RFC3261" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3261"/>.  There are many SIP-specific references and definitions in this document, but future specifications may extend the usage of RCD PASSporTs and claims to other protocol-specific usage and definitions.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">The RCD associated with the identity of the calling party described in this document is of two main categories. The first data is a more traditional set of information about a caller associated with "display-name" in SIP <xref target="RFC3261" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3261"/>, typically a textual description of the caller, or alternate presentation numbers often used in the From header field <xref target="RFC3261" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3261"/> or P-Asserted-Identity header field <xref target="RFC3325" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3325"/>, or an icon associated with the caller. The second category is a set of RCD that is defined as part of the jCard definitions or extensions to that data. <xref target="RFC9796" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9796"/> describes the optional use of jCard in the Call-Info header field as RCD with the "jcard" Call-Info purpose token. Either or both of these two types of data can be incorporated into an "rcd" claim as defined in this document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">Additionally, in relation to the description of the specific communications event itself (versus the identity description in the previous paragraph), <xref target="RFC9796" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9796"/> also describes a "call-reason" parameter intended for description of the intent or reason for a particular call. A new PASSporT claim "crn", or call reason, can contain a string that describes the intent of the call. This claim is intentionally kept separate from the "rcd" claim because it is envisioned that call reason is not the same as information associated with the caller and may change on a more frequent, per-call basis.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-overview-of-rich-call-data-">Overview of Rich Call Data Integrity</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">When incorporating call data that represents a user, even in traditional calling name services today, often there are policy and restrictions around what data elements are allowed to be used. Whether preventing offensive language or icons, enforcing uniqueness, notifying about potential trademark or copyright violations, or enforcing other policies, there might be the desire to pre-certify or "vet" the specific use of RCD. 
   This document defines a mechanism that allows for a direct or 
   indirect party that (a) enforces
   the policies to approve or certify the content, (b) creates a
   cryptographic digest that can be used to validate that data, and
   (c) applies a constraint in the certificate to allow the recipient and
   verifier to validate that the specific content of the RCD is as
   intended at its creation and its approval or certification.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">There are two mechanisms that are defined to accomplish that for two distinct categories of purposes. The first of the mechanisms include the definition of an integrity claim. The RCD integrity mechanism is a process of generating a cryptographic digest for each resource referenced by a URI within a claim value (e.g., an image file referenced by "jcd" or a jCard referenced by "jcl"). This mechanism is inspired by and based on the W3C Subresource Integrity specification <xref target="W3C-SubresourceIntegrity" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="W3C-SubresourceIntegrity"/>. The second of the mechanisms uses the capability called JWT Claim Constraints, defined in <xref target="RFC8226" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8226"/> and extended in <xref target="RFC9118" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9118"/>. The JWT Claim Constraints specifically guide the verifier within the certificate used to compute the signature in the PASSporT for the inclusion (or exclusion) of specific claims and their values, so that the content intended by the signer can be verified to be accurate.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-3">Both of these mechanisms, integrity digests and JWT Claims Constraints, can be used together or separately depending on the intended purpose. The first category of purpose is whether the RCD conveyed in the PASSporT claims is passed by value or passed by reference; i.e., is the information contained in the PASSporT claims and therefore integrity protected by the PASSporT signature, or is the information contained in an external resource referenced by a URI in the PASSporT? The second category of purpose is whether the signer is authoritative or has responsibility for the accuracy of the RCD based on the policies of the ecosystem the "rcd" PASSporTs or "rcd" claims are being used.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">The following table provides an overview of the framework for how integrity should be used with RCD. ("Auth" represents "authoritative" in this table.)</t>
      <table align="center" pn="table-1">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Modes</th>

          </tr>

            <td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4: RCD Integ. / JWT Claim Const.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-6">The first and simplest mode is exclusively for when all RCD content is directly included as part of the claims (i.e., no URIs referencing external content are included in the content) and when the signer is authoritative over the content. In this mode, integrity protection is not required, and the set of claims is simply protected by the signature of the standard PASSporT <xref target="RFC8225" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8225"/> and SIP identity header <xref target="RFC8224" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8224"/> procedures. The second mode is an extension of the first where the signer is authoritative, and an "rcd" claim contents include a URI identifying external resources. In this mode, an RCD Integrity or "rcdi" claim <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be included. This integrity claim is defined later in this document and provides a digest of the "rcd" claim content so that, particularly for the case where there are URI references in the RCD, the content of that RCD can be comprehensively validated that it was received as intended by the signer of the PASSporT.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-7">The third and fourth modes cover cases where there is a different authoritative entity responsible for the content of the RCD, separate from the signer of the PASSporT itself, allowing the ability, in particular when delegating signing authority for PASSporT, for agreed or vetted content to be included in or referenced by the RCD claim contents. The primary framework for allowing the separation of authority and the signing of PASSporTs by non-authorized entities is detailed in <xref target="RFC9060" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9060"/>, although other cases may apply. As with the first and second modes, the third and fourth modes differ with the absence or inclusion of referenced external content using URIs.</t>

Its intended semantics are to convey a number that the originating user is authorized to show to called parties in lieu of their default number, such as cases where a remote call agent uses the main number of a call center instead of their personal telephone number. The "apn" key value is a canonicalized telephone number per <xref section="8.3" target="RFC8224" sectionFormat="comma" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8224#section-8.3" derivedContent="RFC8224"/>.

          <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.2-2">The use of the optional "apn" key is intended for cases where the signer of an "rcd" PASSporT or "rcd" claims authorizes the use of an alternate presentation number by the user. How the signer determines that a user is authorized to present the number in question is a policy decision outside the scope of this document. However, the vetting of the alternate presentation number should follow the same level of vetting as telephone identities or any other information contained in an "rcd" PASSporT or "rcd" claims.
The use of the "apn" key is intended as an alternative to conveying the presentation number in the "tel" key value of a jCard, in situations where no other rich jCard data needs to be conveyed with the call. Only one "apn" key may be present. "apn" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used when it is the intent of the caller or signer to display the alternate presentation number even if "jcd" or "jcl" keys are present in a PASSporT with a "tel" key value.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-1">The use of JWT Claim Constraints with an "rcdi" claim is for cases where URI-referenced content is to be protected by the authoritative certificate issuer. The objective for the use of JWT Claim Constraints for the combination of both "rcd" and "rcdi" claims is to constrain the signer to only construct the "rcd" and "rcdi" claims inside a PASSporT to contain and reference only a predetermined set of content. Once both the contents of the "rcd" claim and any referenced content are certified by the party that is authoritative for the certificate being issued to the signer, the "rcdi" claim is constructed and linked to the STIR certificate associated with the signature in the PASSporT via the JWT Claim Constraints extension as defined in <xref section="8" target="RFC8226" sectionFormat="comma" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8226#section-8" derivedContent="RFC8226"/> and extended in <xref target="RFC9118" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9118"/>. It should be recognized that the "rcdi" set of digests is intended to be unique for only a specific combination of "rcd" content and URI-referenced external content, and therefore the set provides a robust integrity mechanism for an authentication service being performed by a non-authoritative party. 
   For example, this may be used with delegate certificates [RFC9060]
   for the signing of calls by the calling party directly, even though
   the "authorized party" is not necessarily the subject of a STIR
   certificate.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-1">While rich data about the call can be provided by an originating authentication service, an intermediary in the call path could also acquire rich call data by querying a third-party service. Such a service effectively acts as a STIR Authentication Service, generating its own PASSporT, and that PASSporT could be attached to a call by either the originating or terminating side. This third-party PASSporT attests information about the calling number, rather than the call or caller itself, and as such its RCD <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used when a call lacks a first-party PASSporT that assures verification services that the calling party number is not spoofed. A third-party PASSporT is intended to be used in cases when the originating side does not supply a display-name for the caller, so instead some entity in the call path invokes a third-party service to provide rich caller data for a call.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-2">In telephone operations today, a third-party information service is commonly queried with the calling party's number in order to learn the name of the calling party, and potentially other helpful information could also be passed over that interface. The value of using a PASSporT to convey this information from third parties lies largely in the preservation of the third party's signature over the data, and the potential for the PASSporT to be conveyed from intermediaries to endpoint devices. Effectively, these use cases form a sub-case of out-of-band use cases <xref target="RFC8816" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8816"/>. The manner in which third-party services are discovered is outside the scope of this document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-3">An intermediary use case might look as follows using the SIP protocol for this example: a SIP INVITE carries a display name in its From header field value and an initial PASSporT object without the "rcd" claim. When a terminating verification service implemented at a SIP proxy server receives this request and determines that the signature is valid, it might query a third-party service that maps telephone numbers to calling party names. Upon receiving the PASSporT in a response from that third-party service, the terminating side could add a new Identity header field to the request for the PASSporT object provided by the third-party service. It would then forward the INVITE to the terminating user agent. If the display name in the PASSporT object matches, or is string-equivalent to, the display name in the INVITE, then the name would presumably be rendered to the end user by the terminating user agent.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-4">A very similar flow could be followed by an intermediary closer to the origination of the call. Presumably such a service could be implemented at an originating network in order to decouple the systems that sign for calling party numbers from the systems that provide rich data about calls.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-5">In an alternative use case, the terminating user agent might query a third-party service. In this case, no new Identity header field would be generated, though the terminating user agent might receive a PASSporT object in return from the third-party service, and use the "rcd" field in the object as a calling name to render to users while alerting.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-6">While in the traditional telephone network, the business relationship between calling customers and their telephone service providers is the ultimate root of information about a calling party's name, some other forms of data like crowdsourced reputation scores might derive from third parties.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.1-1">A third-party PASSporT contains an "iss" element to distinguish its PASSporTs from first-party PASSporTs. Third-party "rcd" PASSporTs are signed with credentials that do not have authority over the identity that appears in the "orig" element of the PASSporT claims. The presence of "iss" signifies that a different category of credential is being used to sign a PASSporT than the certificates (as defined in <xref target="RFC8226" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8226"/>) used to sign STIR calls; it is instead a certificate that identifies the source of the "rcd" data. How those credentials are issued and managed is outside the scope of this document; however, the value of "iss" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reflect the Subject of the certificate used to sign a third-party PASSporT. The explicit mechanism for reflecting the Subject field of the certificate is out of scope of this document and left to the certificate governance policies that define how to map the "iss" value in the PASSporT to the Subject field in the certificate. Relying parties in STIR have always been left to make their own authorization decisions about whether to trust the signers of PASSporTs; in the third-party case, where an entity has explicitly queried a service to acquire the PASSporT object, it may be some external trust or business relationship that induces the relying party to trust a PASSporT.</t>

Following the rules of <xref target="RFC8225" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8225"/> and in particular if there are multiple identity headers (as in the case of the inclusion of an "rcd" and "shaken" PASSporTs from two different signing providers), a verification service <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> determine that the calling party number shown in the "orig" of the "rcd" PASSporT corresponds to the calling party number of the call it has received, and that the "iat" field of the "rcd" PASSporT is within the date interval that the verification service would ordinarily accept for a PASSporT.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-1">A set of "rcd" claims can be provided by either first-party providers that are directly authorized to sign PASSporTs in the STIR ecosystem or third-party providers that are indirectly or delegated authority to sign PASSporTs. Relying parties could benefit from an additional claim that indicates the identification, in the form of a uniquely identifiable name, of the attesting party to the caller. Even in first-party cases, the Communications Service Provider (CSP) to which a number was assigned might in turn delegate the number to a reseller, who would then sell the number to an enterprise, in which case the CSP might have little insight into the caller's name. In third-party cases, a caller's name could be determined from any number of data sources, on a spectrum between public data scraped from web searches to a direct business relationship to the caller. As multiple PASSporTs can be associated with the same call, potentially a verification service could receive attestations of the caller name from multiple sources, which have different levels of granularity or accuracy. Therefore, third-party PASSporTs that carry "rcd" data are <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to also carry an indication of the identity of the generator of the PASSporT in the form of the 'iss' claim.</t>

The general verification procedures defined in <xref target="rcd_passport_verification" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 8.1"/>
should be followed, but the following paragraphs describe some of the specifics needed to implement a verification service using the SIP protocol.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-12.2-2">If the PASSporT is in compact form, then the verification service <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> extract the display-name from the From header field value, if any, and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use that as the string value for the "nam" key when it recomputes the header and claims of the PASSporT object. Additionally, if there exists a Call-Info header field as defined in <xref target="RFC9796" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9796"/>, the "jcard" JSON object value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used to construct the "jcd" key value when it recomputes the header and claims of the PASSporT object. If the signature validates over the recomputed object, then the verification is considered successful.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-12.2-3">If the PASSporT is in full form with a PASSporT extension value of "rcd", then the verification service <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> extract the value associated with the "rcd" claim "nam" key in the object. If the PASSporT signature is verified successfully, then the verification service <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> additionally compare the string value of the "rcd" claim "nam" key value with the From header field value or the preferred value.  The preferred value depends on local policy of the SIP network technique that conveys the display name string through a field other than the From header field to interoperate with this specification (e.g., P-Asserted-Identity) as discussed in <xref target="RFC8224" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8224"/>. 
Similarly, "jcd", "jcl", "icn", "apn", or "crn" elements
can be used optionally (based on local policy for devices that support it)
to populate a Call-Info header field following the format of
<xref target="RFC9796" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9796"/>. If PASSporT RCD claims types defined in the future are present, they should follow similar defined procedures and policies.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-12.2-4">The behavior of a SIP User Agent Server (UAS) upon receiving an INVITE or other type of session initiation request containing a PASSporT object with an "rcd" claim largely remains a matter of implementation policy. In most cases, implementations would render this calling party name information to the user while alerting. Any user interface additions to express confidence in the veracity of this information are outside the scope of this specification.</t>

For cases where the entity originating the personal communications is supporting the authentication service for the calling identity and is the authority of the Rich Call Data, rather than creating multiple Identity header fields corresponding to multiple PASSporT extensions, the authentication service can alternatively directly add the "rcd" claim to a PASSporT that authenticates the calling identity.</t>

This can be of many forms, depending on the setup and constraints of the policy requirements of the ecosystem, and is therefore out of scope of this document. However, the general chain of trust that signers of "rcd" PASSporT are either directly authoritative or have been delegated authority through certificates using JWT Claim Constraints and integrity mechanisms defined in this and related documents is critical to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem utilizing this and other STIR-related specifications.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-2">Revealing information such as the name, location, and affiliation of a person necessarily entails certain privacy risks. Baseline PASSporT has no particular confidentiality requirement, as the information it signs in many current base communications protocols (for example, SIP) is information that is carried in the clear anyway. Transport-level security can hide those SIP fields from eavesdroppers, and the same confidentiality mechanisms would protect any PASSporT(s) carried in SIP.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-3">The dereferencing and download of any RCD URI-linked resources as part of verification either in-network or on device could provide some level of information about calling patterns, so this should be considered when making these resources available.</t>

The use of the "rcdi" claim and digests for representing JWT claim contents is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> for the prevention of the exposure of that information through the certificates that are often publicly accessible and available.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-5">Since computation of "rcdi" digests for URIs requires the loading of referenced content, it would be best practice to validate that content at the creation of the "rcdi" or corresponding JWT claim constraint value by checking for content that may cause issues for verification services or that doesn't follow the behavior defined in this document, e.g., unreasonably sized data, the inclusion of recursive URI references, etc. Along the same lines, the verification service should also use precautionary best practices to avoid attacks when accessing URI-linked content.</t>

              <t indent="0">Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have replaced many traditional telephony deployments. Interworking VoIP systems with the traditional telephone network has reduced the overall level of calling party number and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks. Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the calling party in a VoIP session. This document examines the reasons why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions. It also gives high-level requirements for a solution in this space.</t>
