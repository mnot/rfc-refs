               Deprecate Usage of ECC-GOST within DNSSEC

Abstract

   This document retires the use of GOST R 34.10-2001 (mnemonic "ECC-
   GOST") and GOST R 34.11-94 within DNSSEC.

   RFC 5933 (Historic) defined the use of GOST R 34.10-2001 and GOST R
   34.11-94 algorithms with DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  This
   document updates RFC 5933 by deprecating the use of ECC-GOST.

1.  Introduction

   The GOST R 34.10-2001 and GOST R 34.11-94 algorithms are documented
   in [RFC5933] and their use with DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is
   further described in [RFC9364].  These two algorithms were deprecated
   by the Orders of the Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and
   Metrology of Russia (Rosstandart) in August 2012 and were superseded
   by GOST 34.10-2012 and GOST 34.11-2012, respectively.  The use of
   these two newer algorithms in DNSSEC is documented in [RFC9558], and
   their associated requirement levels are not changed by this document.

   Thus, the use of GOST R 34.10-2001 (mnemonic "ECC-GOST") and GOST R
   34.11-94 is no longer recommended for use in DNSSEC [RFC9364].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Deprecating ECC-GOST Algorithms in DNSSEC

   The GOST R 34.11-94 algorithm [RFC5933] MUST NOT be used when
   creating Delegation Signer (DS) records.  Validating resolvers MUST
   treat GOST R 34.11-94 DS records as insecure.  If no other DS records
   of accepted cryptographic algorithms are available, the DNS records
   below the delegation point MUST be treated as insecure.

   The GOST R 34.10-2001 algorithm [RFC5933] (mnemonic "ECC-GOST") MUST
   NOT be used when creating DNS Public Key (DNSKEY) and Resource Record
   Signature (RRSIG) records.  Validating resolvers MUST treat RRSIG
   records created from DNSKEY records using these algorithms as
   unsupported algorithms.  If no other RRSIG records of accepted
   cryptographic algorithms are available, the validating resolver MUST
   consider the associated resource records as insecure.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document potentially increases the security of the DNSSEC
   ecosystem by deprecating algorithms that are no longer recommended
   for use.

4.  Operational Considerations

   This document removes support for ECC-GOST.  Zone operators currently
   making use of ECC-GOST-based algorithms should switch to algorithms
   that remain supported.  DNS registries should prohibit their clients
   from uploading and publishing ECC-GOST-based DS records to ensure
   that they are using algorithms that are supported by DNSSEC
   validators and thus can be DNSSEC validated.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated the GOST R 34.10-2001 (12) entry in the "DNS
   Security Algorithm Numbers" registry [DNSKEY-IANA] [RFC9904] as
   follows:

   Number:  12
   Description:  GOST R 34.10-2001 (DEPRECATED)
   Mnemonic:  ECC-GOST
   Zone Signing:  Y
   Trans.  Sec.:  *
   Use for DNSSEC Signing:  MUST NOT
   Use for DNSSEC Validation:  MUST NOT
   Implement for DNSSEC Signing:  MUST NOT
   Implement for DNSSEC Validation:  MUST NOT
   Reference:  [RFC5933], Change the status of GOST Signature Algorithms
      in DNSSEC in the IETF stream to Historic
      (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/status-change-gost-dnssec-to-
      historic/), and RFC 9906

   Note: The "Use for DNSSEC Signing" and "Implement for DNSSEC
   Delegation" columns were already set to MUST NOT.

   IANA has updated the GOST R 34.11-94 (3) entry in the "Digest
   Algorithms" registry [DS-IANA] as follows:

   Value:  3
   Description:  GOST R 34.11-94 (DEPRECATED)
   Use for DNSSEC Delegation:  MUST NOT
   Use for DNSSEC Validation:  MUST NOT
   Implement for DNSSEC Delegation:  MUST NOT
   Implement for DNSSEC Validation:  MUST NOT
   Reference:  [RFC5933], Change the status of GOST Signature Algorithms
      in DNSSEC in the IETF stream to Historic
      (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/status-change-gost-dnssec-to-
      historic/), and RFC 9906

   Note: The "Use for DNSSEC Signing" and "Implement for DNSSEC
   Delegation" columns were already set to MUST NOT.
