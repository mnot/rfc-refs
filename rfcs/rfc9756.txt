 Update to the IANA Path Communication Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers
 Registration Procedures and the Allowance of Experimental Error Codes

Abstract

   This document updates the registration procedure within the IANA
   "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group.
   This specification changes some of the registries with Standards
   Action to IETF Review as defined in RFC 8126 and thus updates RFCs
   8231, 8233, 8281, 8623, 8664, 8685, 8697, 8733, 8745, 8779, 8780,
   8800, 8934, 9050, 9059, 9168, 9357, 9504, 9603, and 9604.

   Designating "experimental use" sub-ranges within codepoint registries
   is often beneficial for protocol experimentation in controlled
   environments.  Although the registries for PCEP messages, objects,
   and TLV types have sub-ranges assigned for Experimental Use, the
   registry for PCEP Error-Types and Error-values currently does not.
   This document updates RFC 5440 by designating a specific range of
   PCEP Error-Types for Experimental Use.

1.  Introduction

   The IANA "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry
   group was populated by several RFCs produced by the Path Computation
   Element (PCE) Working Group.  Most of the registries include IETF
   Review [RFC8126] as the registration procedure.  There are a few
   registries that use Standards Action.  Thus, the values in those
   registries can be assigned only through the Standards Track or Best
   Current Practice RFCs in the IETF Stream.  This memo changes the
   policy from Standards Action to IETF Review to allow any type of RFC
   under the IETF Stream to make the allocation request.

   Further, in Section 9 of [RFC5440], IANA assigns values to the PCEP
   parameters.  The allocation policy for each of these parameters
   specified in [RFC5440] is IETF Review [RFC8126].  In consideration of
   the benefits of conducting experiments with PCEP and the utility of
   experimental codepoints [RFC3692], codepoint ranges for PCEP
   messages, objects, and TLV types for Experimental Use [RFC8126] are
   designated in [RFC8356].  However, protocol experiments may also need
   to return protocol error messages indicating experiment-specific
   error cases.  It will often be that previously assigned error codes
   (in the "PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values" registry) can be
   used to indicate the error cases within an experiment, but there may
   also be instances where new, experimental error codes are needed.  In
   order to run experiments, it is important that the codepoint values
   used in the experiments do not collide with existing codepoints or
   any future allocations.  This document updates [RFC5440] by changing
   the allocation policy for the registry of PCEP Error-Types to mark
   some of the codepoints as assigned for Experimental Use.  As stated
   in [RFC3692], experiments using these codepoints are not intended to
   be used in general deployments, and due care must be taken to ensure
   that two experiments using the same codepoints are not run in the
   same environment.

2.  Standards Action PCEP Registries Affected

   The following table lists the registries under the "Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group whose registration
   policies have been changed from Standards Action to IETF Review.  The
   affected registries list this document as an additional reference.
   Where this change has been applied to a specific range of values
   within the particular registry, that range is given in the Remarks
   column.

                    Table 1: PCEP Registries Affected

   Future registries in the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   Numbers" registry group should prefer to use IETF Review over
   Standards Action.

3.  Experimental Error-Types

   Per this document, IANA has designated four PCEP Error-Type
   codepoints (252-255) for Experimental Use.

   IANA maintains the "PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values"
   registry under the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers"
   registry group.  IANA has changed the assignment policy for the
   "PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values" registry as follows:

     +=========+==============+=====================================+
     | Range   | Registration | Note                                |
     |         | Procedures   |                                     |
     +=========+==============+=====================================+
     | 0-251   | IETF Review  | The IETF Review procedure applies   |
     |         |              | to all Error-values (0-255) for     |
     |         |              | Error-Types in this range.          |
     +---------+--------------+-------------------------------------+
     | 252-255 | Experimental | The Experimental Use policy applies |
     |         | Use          | to all Error-values (0-255) for     |
     |         |              | Error-Types in this range.          |
     +---------+--------------+-------------------------------------+

        Table 2: PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values Registry
                            Assignment Policy

   Furthermore, IANA has added the following entry to the registry:

    +============+==================+=====================+===========+
    | Error-Type | Meaning          | Error-value         | Reference |
    +============+==================+=====================+===========+
    | 252-255    | Reserved for     | 0-255: Reserved for | RFC 9756  |
    |            | Experimental Use | Experimental Use    |           |
    +------------+------------------+---------------------+-----------+

         Table 3: PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values Registry

3.1.  Advice on Experimentation

   An experiment that wishes to return experimental error codes should
   use one of the experimental Error-Type values as defined in this
   document.  The experiment should agree on, between all participating
   parties, which Error-Type to use and which Error-values to use within
   that Error-Type.  The experiment will describe what the meanings of
   those Error-Type/Error-value pairs are.  Those Error-Types and Error-
   values should not be recorded in any public (especially any IETF)
   documentation.  Textual or symbolic names for the Error-Types and
   Error-values may be used to help keep the documentation clear.

   If multiple experiments are taking place at the same time using the
   same implementations, care must be taken to keep the sets of Error-
   Types/Error-values distinct.

   Note that there is no scope for experimental Error-values within
   existing non-experimental Error-Types.  This reduces the complexity
   of the registry and implementations.  Experiments should place all
   experimental Error-values under the chosen experimental Error-Types.

   If, at some future time, the experiment is declared a success and
   moved to IETF work targeting publication on the Standards Track, each
   pair of Error-Types/Error-values will need to be assigned by IANA
   from the registry.  In some cases, this will involve assigning a new
   Error-Type with its subtended Error-values.  In other cases, use may
   be made of an existing Error-Type with new subtended Error-values
   being assigned.  The resulting change to code in an implementation is
   as simple as changing the numeric values of the Error-Types and
   Error-values.

3.2.  Handling of Unknown Experimentation

   A PCEP implementation that receives an experimental Error-Type in a
   PCEP message and does not recognize the Error-Type (i.e., is not part
   of the experiment) will treat the error as it would treat any other
   unknown Error-Type (such as from a new protocol extension).  An
   implementation that is notified of a PCEP error will normally close
   the PCEP session (see [RFC5440]).  In general, PCEP implementations
   are not required to take specific action based on Error-Types but may
   log the errors for diagnostic purposes.

   An implementation that is part of an experiment may receive an
   experimental Error-Type but not recognize the Error-value.  This
   could happen because of any of the following reasons:

   *  a faulty implementation

   *  two implementations not being synchronized with respect to which
      Error-values to use in the experiment

   *  more than one experiment being run at the same time

   As with unknown Error-Types, an implementation receiving an unknown
   Error-value is not expected to do more than log the received error
   and may close the PCEP session.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo is entirely about updating the IANA "Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group.

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not change the security considerations for any of the
   updated RFCs.  Refer to [RFC5440] and [PCEPS-UPDATES] for further
   details of the specific security measures applicable to PCEP.

   [RFC3692] asserts that the existence of experimental codepoints
   introduces no new security considerations.  However, implementations
   accepting experimental error codepoints need to consider how they
   parse and process them in case they come, accidentally, from another
   experiment.  Further, an implementation accepting experimental
   codepoints needs to consider the security aspects of the experimental
   extensions.  [RFC6709] provides various design considerations for
   protocol extensions (including those designated as experimental).

Appendix A.  Rationale for Updating All Registries with Standards Action

   This specification updates all the mentioned registries with the
   Standards Action policy.  The PCE WG considered keeping Standards
   Action for some registries, such as flag fields with limited bits
   where the space is tight, but decided against it.  The Working Group
   Last Call and IETF Last Call processes should be enough to handle the
   case of frivolous experiments taking over the few codepoints.  The
   working group could also create a new protocol field and registry for
   future use as done in the past (see [RFC9357]).

Appendix B.  Consideration of RFC 8356

   It is worth noting that [RFC8356] deliberately chose to make
   experimental codepoints available only in the PCEP messages, objects,
   and TLV type registries.  Appendix A of [RFC8356] gives a brief
   explanation of why that decision was taken, stating that:

   |  The justification for this decision is that, if an experiment
   |  finds that it wants to use a new codepoint in another PCEP sub-
   |  registry, it can implement the same function using a new
   |  experimental object or TLV instead.

   While it is true that an experimental implementation could assign an
   experimental PCEP object and designate it the "experimental errors
   object", using it to carry arbitrary contents including experimental
   error codes, such an approach would cause unnecessary divergence in
   the code.  The allowance of experimental Error-Types is a better
   approach that will more easily enable the migration of successful
   experiments onto the Standards Track.
