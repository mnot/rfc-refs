   Transferring Opportunistic Wireless Encryption to the IEEE 802.11
                             Working Group

Abstract

   RFC 8110 describes Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), a mode
   that allows unauthenticated clients to connect to a network using
   encrypted traffic.  This document transfers the ongoing maintenance
   and further development of the protocol to the IEEE 802.11 Working
   Group.

   This document updates RFC 8110 by noting that future work on the
   protocol described therein will occur in the IEEE 802.11 Working
   Group.

1.  Introduction

   Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) [RFC8110] is a mode of
   opportunistic security [RFC7435] for IEEE Std 802.11 that provides
   encryption of the wireless medium without authentication.

   Since publication, [RFC8110] (also known as "[Wi-Fi_Enhanced_Open]")
   has been widely implemented and deployed.

   The IEEE 802.11 Working Group [IEEE_802.11] has requested the ability
   to maintain and develop OWE (see [IEEE_LS]) to ensure that the
   protocol remains in sync with the IEEE protocols.  This document
   represents concurrence that future work on OWE [RFC8110] will now
   occur in the IEEE 802.11 Working Group.

2.  Transfer of Maintenance

   This document represents concurrence that future work on OWE
   [RFC8110] will now occur in the IEEE 802.11 Working Group
   [IEEE_802.11] to ensure that the protocol remains in sync with the
   IEEE protocols.

   The OWE protocol [RFC8110] will be duplicated by the IEEE 802.11
   Working Group [IEEE_802.11] such that the document alone will be
   enough to implement, maintain, and modify the protocol within the
   IEEE under its policies and procedures.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document simply notes that future work on the protocol described
   in [RFC8110] will now occur in the IEEE.  As such, it does not
   introduce any new security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank the IEEE 802.11 Working Group for
   their work, and for taking on the responsibility for future work on
   the protocol described in RFC 8110.

   In addition, we would like to thank Stephen Farrell, the AD that
   sponsored the original work, as well as Clemens Schimpe, Dorothy
   Stanley, Paul Wouters, Eric Vyncke, Mike Montemurro, and Peter Yee.

   Apologies to anyone we forgot to acknowledge; RFC 8110 was written 7+
   years ago and we have had many conversations with many people since
   then...
